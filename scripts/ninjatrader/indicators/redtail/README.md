### 🔴 [RedTail LVN Hunter](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-LVN-Hunter)

A lightweight, standalone Low Volume Node detector for NinjaTrader 8. This is the LVN detection engine extracted from RedTail Volume Profile into its own focused indicator — ideal if you just want clean LVN zones on your chart without the full volume profile overlay.

**How It Works**
- Builds an internal volume profile across a configurable lookback range, then scans for local volume troughs — price levels where volume is significantly lower than surrounding levels
- Detected LVNs are drawn as shaded rectangles extending across the full chart, highlighting potential breakout zones and key support/resistance areas

**Lookback Modes**
- **Fixed Bars** — Analyzes the last N bars (configurable, 50–5000)
- **Session** — Resets and recalculates at the start of each new session

**Detection Settings**
- **Profile Number of Rows** — Controls granularity of the volume analysis (more rows = finer/noisier LVNs, fewer rows = broader/smoother zones)
- **LVN Detection %** — Sensitivity threshold for identifying troughs (lower = more sensitive)
- **Show Adjacent LVN Nodes** — Expands each detected LVN to include the neighboring price levels above and below, creating wider zone rectangles

**Display**
- Customizable fill color, fill opacity, border color, and border opacity for all LVN rectangles
- Optimized for performance — only calculates on real-time bars and the last historical bar to minimize loading time

Designed for traders who use ICT/Po3 methodology and want precise, mathematical reference levels on their charts.

**Two Operating Modes**
- **Dynamic Mode** — Settlement price sits at the center (50%) of the range, with Goldbach levels mapped symmetrically above and below
- **Fixed Mode** — Calculates the Po3 partition from base 0 that contains the current price, with optional half-shift offset for alignment tuning

**Po3 Range Sizes**
- Preset ranges following the Power of 3 sequence: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, 177,147, 531,441

- **Non-Goldbach / Semi-Prime Levels** — 23, 35, 65, 77
- **Inverted Goldbach Levels** — 14, 32, 38, 56, 74, 79, 92, 95, 98
- **Midpoint Levels** — Calculated between adjacent main levels
- **Equilibrium (50%)** — Drawn in Fixed mode as a separate reference
- **Premium/Discount area shading** with PD zone labels (High, Rejection, Order Block, FVG, Liq Void, Breaker, Mitigation)

**Po3 Stop Runs & Standard Deviation Levels**
- **Stop run levels** projected beyond the range boundaries at configurable distances (PO3-2, PO3-3, or PO3-4 subdivisions)
- **Standard deviation levels** — evenly spaced interval lines radiating from the fix price, useful for measuring extensions

**Smart Level Merging**
- When multiple levels fall within a configurable tick threshold, they merge into a single labeled line showing all confluent levels — reduces chart clutter while preserving information

### 🔴 [RedTail VWAP Fib Bands](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-VWAP-Fib-Bands)

A MIDAS VWAP indicator for NinjaTrader 8 with three standard deviation band pairs and configurable Fibonacci sub-bands interpolated between them. Based on Paul Levine's MIDAS (Market Interpretation/Data Analysis System) methodology — not a replacement for the standard session VWAP, but a complementary tool that frames the VWAP within a volatility envelope for identifying mean-reversion zones, trend extensions, and statistical extremes.

> Converted from Pine Script by Zeiierman (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

**How It Differs From Standard VWAP**
- Standard VWAP gives you one line — this indicator wraps it in three band pairs (±1σ, ±2σ, ±3σ) plus Fibonacci sub-bands, creating a complete volatility framework around the VWAP anchor
- Uses MIDAS-style anchoring — Session (futures open), Timeframe (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly), or a fixed Date anchor — rather than being limited to a single session reset
- Fibonacci sub-bands are interpolated between MIDAS and the ±3σ extremes, giving you intermediate reference levels between the standard deviation bands (e.g., 0.333 ≈ ±1σ, 0.5 = midpoint, 0.667 ≈ ±2σ, 0.786 = deep extension)

**Anchor Methods**
- **Session** — Resets at a configurable hour (default: 6 PM ET / futures open). Bars before the session hour belong to the prior session.
- **Timeframe** — Resets at the start of each new Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly period
- **Date** — Anchors from a fixed date and never resets — useful for anchoring from a specific swing high/low in history

**Band Structure**
- **±1σ (Band 1)** — Inner mean-reversion zone. Price oscillating between +1σ and -1σ indicates a range-bound market.
- **±2σ (Band 2)** — Extension zone. A close beyond ±2σ signals trending conditions.
- **±3σ (Band 3)** — Extreme zone. A close beyond ±3σ is a statistically rare event.
- **Fibonacci Sub-Bands** — Configurable comma-separated ratios (default: 0.333, 0.5, 0.667, 0.786) interpolated between MIDAS and ±3σ. Add or remove levels freely.

**Fill Zones**
- Three graduated fill zones between the band pairs, each with automatically decreasing opacity (inner = full, middle = 60%, outer = 35%) for a visual heat-map effect

**Visual**
- Independent Stroke settings (color, dash style, width) for MIDAS, Band 1, Band 2, Band 3, and Fibonacci lines
- Optional right-edge labels for every level (σ notation for bands, decimal notation for fibs)
- All core values exposed as plot outputs (MIDAS, Upper/Lower 1–3, all Fib levels) for use by strategies or other indicators
- Rendered via SharpDX with polygon-traced fill geometry

### 🔴 [RedTail Swing Anchored VWAP](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-Swing-Anchored-VWAP)

An adaptive swing-anchored VWAP indicator for NinjaTrader 8 that automatically detects swing highs and lows, then anchors a VWAP from each pivot point using EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) smoothing instead of traditional cumulative VWAP — producing a smoother, more responsive VWAP that adapts to changing market conditions.

> Converted from Pine Script by Zeiierman (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

**How It Works**
- Detects swing highs and lows using a configurable lookback period
- When a swing direction change occurs (new swing high after a series of lows, or vice versa), the VWAP re-anchors from the pivot bar and recalculates forward to the current bar
- Uses EWMA instead of cumulative VWAP — an exponential decay function weights recent volume more heavily, so the VWAP reacts faster to current price action while still respecting the anchor point
- The VWAP line changes color based on the current swing direction: bullish (anchored from a swing low) or bearish (anchored from a swing high)

**Adaptive Price Tracking**
- **Adaptive Price Tracking (APT)** — Controls the EWMA half-life, which determines how quickly the VWAP reacts to new data. Lower values = tighter/faster tracking, higher values = smoother/slower.
- **ATR-Adaptive Mode** — When enabled, the APT value automatically adjusts based on current volatility relative to its own smoothed average. In high-volatility environments the VWAP tightens up; in low-volatility conditions it smooths out. Controlled by a Volatility Bias parameter that sets how aggressively volatility influences the adaptation.

**Historical Display**
- Optionally show all previous VWAP segments from prior swing anchors, creating a visual trail of swing-to-swing VWAPs across the chart

**Visual**
- Independent bullish and bearish VWAP colors
- Configurable line width (1–10), opacity (0–100%), and dash style
- VWAP value exposed as a plot output for use in the data box, crosshair, or by other indicators/strategies
- Rendered via SharpDX for performance

### 🔴 [RedTail Quick Alert](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-Quick-Alert)

A hotkey-driven price alert tool for NinjaTrader 8. Hover your mouse at any price level and press a keyboard shortcut to instantly place an alert line — no dialog boxes, no menus, no clicks on the price axis. Designed for speed during live trading.

**How It Works**
- Hover your cursor at the desired price on the chart and press **Ctrl+A** (default) to set an alert at that exact price
- Alert lines are drawn across the chart with a price label — when price crosses the level, a sound alert fires and optionally a popup appears
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** (default) to remove all alerts at once
- Click the **X button** rendered on any alert line to remove it individually

### 🔴 [RedTail EMA Cloud](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-EMA-Cloud)

A multi-layered moving average cloud indicator for NinjaTrader 8 that renders up to 5 independent EMA (or SMA) clouds on your chart for visual trend identification at a glance. Each cloud is formed by the filled region between a short and long moving average pair, changing color based on bullish or bearish crossover state.

**5 Independent Clouds**
- **Cloud 1** — Default 8/9 (tight scalping cloud)
- **Cloud 2** — Default 5/12 (short-term momentum)
- **Cloud 3** — Default 34/50 (medium-term trend)
- **Cloud 4** — Default 72/89 (intermediate trend)
- **Cloud 5** — Default 180/200 (long-term trend)
- Each cloud can be toggled on/off independently — use any combination that fits your style

**MA Type Selection**
- Switch between **EMA** and **SMA** globally — all 5 clouds recalculate with the selected type

**Visual Customization**
- Independent **bullish and bearish colors** for each cloud
- Independent **opacity** control per cloud (0–100)
- **Cloud leading offset** — shift clouds forward by N bars for anticipatory visual alignment
- Optional **EMA line overlay** — draws the individual short and long MA lines on top of the clouds with rising/falling color coding

**Alerts**
- Optional long and short crossover alerts when the short MA crosses above or below the long MA

### 🔴 [RedTail Candle Shadows](https://github.com/3astbeast/RedTail-Candle-Shadows)

A visual enhancement indicator for NinjaTrader 8 that draws subtle drop shadows beneath candle bodies and wicks for improved depth and readability. A small cosmetic touch that makes charts easier on the eyes during long trading sessions.

**Shadow Rendering**
- Shadows drawn on both **candle bodies** and **wicks** (each toggleable independently)
- Configurable **X and Y pixel offset** to control shadow direction and distance
- **Wick opacity multiplier** — wicks get a lighter shadow than bodies for a natural look
- Handles dojis gracefully with a minimum body height

**Optional Blur Effect**
- Simulates a soft shadow with multiple render passes at decreasing opacity
- Configurable **blur passes** (1–3) for varying softness levels

**Display**
- Customizable **shadow color** and **opacity** (1–100%)
- **Body width adjustment** — fine-tune the shadow width relative to the candle
- Rendered via SharpDX for minimal performance impact
- Optimized for scalping on low timeframes

### 🔴 [CVD Zones Premium](https://github.com/3astbeast/CVD-Zones-Premium)

A Cumulative Volume Delta heatmap indicator for NinjaTrader 8 that renders a thermal overlay directly on price candles, showing where buying and selling volume concentrates across price levels. Includes a companion indicator that mirrors the heatmap onto charts running different bar types (tick, range, Renko) for the same instrument — no data series linking required.

> Original TradingView Pine Script by **[B3AR_Trades](https://www.tradingview.com/u/B3AR_Trades/)**. NinjaTrader 8 conversion by @_hawkeye_13.

**How It Works**
- Splits each bar's volume into estimated buy and sell components using the bar's OHLC range, then distributes the delta across 62 price bins spanning the lookback range
- Each bin is color-mapped to a thermal gradient — bullish delta glows in one color, bearish in another, with intensity proportional to the magnitude
- The result is a heatmap painted directly on the candle area showing where volume-weighted buying or selling pressure is concentrated

**CVD Settings**
- **Profile Depth** — Shallow (100 bars), Balanced (300), or Deep (600) lookback
- **CVD Mode** — Net CVD (buy minus sell, showing directional pressure) or Cumulative CVD (buy plus sell, showing total activity)
- **Threshold %** — Filters out bars where the buy/sell imbalance is below this percentage of the max, reducing noise
- **Volume-Weighted Midpoint** — Assigns volume to HLC/3 instead of close price for smoother distribution
- **Normalization Approximation** — Alternative normalization for more even gradient spread

**Heatmap Display**
- **Thermal Sensitivity** — High Contrast, Balanced, or Smooth gradient curves
- **Gradient Normalization** — Linear or Logarithmic scaling
- **Heatmap Opacity** — 0 (fully opaque) to 100 (fully transparent)
- **Hide Active Candle** — Clears heatmap bins overlapping the candle's open, close, midpoint, and HLC/3 so the candle body remains readable

**Color Themes**
- 7 built-in themes: Traditional, Modern, Heatwave, Stealth, Aurora, Magma, Plasma
- Custom theme option with user-defined bullish and bearish colors

**Companion Indicator (CVDZonesPremiumCompanion)**
- Add CVDZonesPremium to any chart (e.g., a 5-minute chart), then add the Companion to a different chart type for the same instrument (e.g., a 386-tick chart) — the Companion mirrors the heatmap automatically
- Uses a static ConcurrentDictionary registry for zero-configuration discovery — no manual linking
- Aligns source bars onto the companion chart using timestamps (not bar indices), so bar type mismatches are handled correctly
- Inherits theme colors, CVD mode, sensitivity, and normalization from the source, with an optional opacity override
- Connection status label shows whether the companion is connected or searching
