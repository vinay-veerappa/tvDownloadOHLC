## 2. Strategy Rules

### Core Logic
1.  **Opening Range:** Identify the High and Low of the first 1-minute candle (9:30-9:31 ET).
2.  **Entry:**
    *   **Long:** Close > Range High.
    *   **Short:** Close < Range Low.
3.  **Stop Loss:** The opposite side of the Opening Range.
4.  **Target:** 2.0R (2x Risk).
5.  **Hard Time Exit:** Close all positions at 9:44 AM ET.

### Critical Modifications ( The "Alpha" )
1.  **The 0% Exit Rule:** If *any* 1-minute candle closes back inside the Opening Range after entry, **CLOSE IMMEDIATELY**. Do not wait for Stop Loss.
2.  **The 0.25% Filter:** If the Opening Range height is greater than **0.25%** of the asset price, **SKIP THE TRADE**. 
    *   *Why?* Analysis shows these "Wide Range" days have significantly higher failure rates and irregular volatility.

## 4. Trader's Analysis (Deep Insights)

We analyzed specific characteristics of trade behavior to optimize performance.

### A. The "Sweet Spot" (Range Size)
Not all breakouts are equal. The size of the 9:30 range is predictive.
*   **Micro (< 0.10%)**: Stable but low reward.
*   **Tight (0.10% - 0.18%)**: **THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE.** Highest consistency and avg PnL per trade.
*   **Normal (0.18% - 0.25%)**: Acceptable.
*   **Wide (> 0.25%)**: Profitable in strong bull runs, but historically dangerous (account killers in 2008). **Recommendation: Avoid.**

### B. Day of Week Bias
*   **Best Days:** **Monday, Tuesday, Thursday**. (~42% Win Rate on Mondays).
*   **Worst Day:** **Friday**. Typically lower volume/follow-through for this specific setup.

### C. Psychological Reality Check
*   **Win Rate:** ~37%. You will lose more often than you win.
*   **Max Losing Streak:** **16 Trades**. 
    *   *Warning:* If you cannot mentally handle 16 losses in a row (approx 3 weeks), you will abandon the strategy right before it pays out.
