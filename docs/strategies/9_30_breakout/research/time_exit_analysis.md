### Key Observations

#### 1. **Trade Duration Increases Significantly**
- **9:44 Exit:** Avg ~8-9 minutes
- **No Time Exit:** Avg ~30-75 minutes (varies by year/volatility)
- **2020 Example:** Avg 74 minutes (over 1 hour per trade)

#### 2. **Win Rate DECREASES**
- **Paradox:** More profit, but lower win rate
- **Explanation:** Trades that would have been "saved" by the 9:44 exit (small losses avoided) now run longer and hit full stop losses
- **BUT:** The winners run MUCH further, more than compensating

#### 3. **2018 Flips from Loss to Profit**
The only losing year (+139 pts vs -22 pts) becomes profitable when given time.

#### 4. **High Volatility Years Benefit Most**
- **2022 (Bear Market):** +280% improvement
- **2021 (Liquidity):** +136% improvement
- **2020 (COVID):** +93% improvement

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | 9:44 Exit | No Time Exit |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Total PnL** | +4,418 pts | +9,478 pts ✓ |
| **Win Rate** | ~37% | ~23% |
| **Avg Duration** | 8-9 min | 30-75 min |
| **Intraday Focus** | ✓ Clean | Holds positions |
| **Psychological** | Easier (quick) | Harder (patience) |
| **Overnight Risk** | None ✓ | None (closes 4PM) |
| **Monitoring** | 15 min window | All day |

---

### Recommendation

**For Maximum Profitability:** Remove the 9:44 exit.

**However, consider:**
1. **Lifestyle:** Can you monitor trades until 4 PM?
2. **Psychology:** Can you handle a 23% win rate (lose 3 out of 4)?
3. **Capital Efficiency:** Longer trades = capital tied up longer

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use **No Time Exit** on high-conviction days (tight ranges 0.10-0.18%)
- Use **9:44 Exit** on marginal setups (0.20-0.25% ranges)
