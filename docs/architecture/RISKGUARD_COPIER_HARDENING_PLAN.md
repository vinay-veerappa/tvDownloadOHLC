## 0. Why this review, and what the baseline gives us

Our addons and the V12 strategy solve overlapping problems — multi-account replication and
automated protection of unprotected positions — but from opposite directions:

| Concern | Our addons | V12 (`universal-or-strategy`) |
|---|---|---|
| Replication trigger | `Account.ExecutionUpdate` on the leader, fan-out to followers | Strategy-internal dispatch (`ExecuteSmartDispatchEntry`) before the master order is even submitted |
| Follower risk anchor | none — followers get scaled market orders | `AnchorSnapshot` pinned to the **master's actual weighted fill**, plus `SlippageCushionPoints` |
| Follower brackets | none (`EnableFollowerAtm` is dead config) | "Path B" fixed brackets submitted with the entry |
| Naked-position defense | per-position FSM + one-shot grace timer | FSM **plus** an independent REAPER audit loop that re-derives truth from the broker every cycle |
| Concurrency | one global `lock (_stateLock)`, work marshaled to the WPF dispatcher | zero `lock()`; actor/`Enqueue` model, background audit thread marshals only order calls |
| Submit safety | submit, then record state | reserve/record state **under lock before** submit, roll back on null/reject |
| Desync repair | `ReconcileFollowerPosition` exists but is never called | `REAPER.Repair` + `REAPER.NakedStop` with in-flight dedupe dictionaries and grace windows |

The single most important structural idea to borrow is **REAPER's separation of concerns**:
the FSM is an optimistic fast path, and a *separate, independent auditor* re-derives ground
truth from the broker and repairs whatever the fast path missed. Our FSM has no such
backstop — `FsmWatchdog()` (RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1763) only writes a log line. Every P0 below
is a case where the fast path can lose the position and nothing recovers it.

The second idea worth borrowing is the **reserve-before-submit / rollback-on-failure**
discipline (V12's `A1-1/A2-1` pattern), which we currently invert.

Conversely, we have things V12 lacks and should keep: shadow mode with a preflight gate
(`RunPreflight`, `MinShadowSessions`), friction-gated lockout override, JSONL intervention
log + heartbeat file, and `SeedFsmsForExistingPositions` — a genuinely good state
re-derivation routine that is currently called from only one place.

## 1. P0 — Naked-risk and wrong-size defects (fix before any live use)

### P0-1. FSM returning to `Unprotected` never re-arms the grace timer → permanent naked position
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1667-1677` (`UpdateFsmOnOrder`, terminal-stop branch), `1763-1776` (`FsmWatchdog`)
**What happens**: When the recognised protective stop goes terminal (cancelled by the user,
rejected by the broker, or filled on a partial) while the position is still open, the FSM is
set back to `Unprotected` — but no new `GraceTimer` is armed. Grace expiry moved off the sweep
onto per-FSM one-shot timers (`UpdateFsmOnPosition:1591-1606`), and the timer was disposed when
the FSM first left `Unprotected` (`1700-1704`). `EvaluateGraceExpiry` is called from exactly one
place, `OnGraceExpired` (`1633`), so nothing will ever fire again for that position.
`FsmWatchdog` notices and logs `FSM_WATCHDOG` every 5 s, forever, without acting.
**Impact**: Cancel your stop manually (or have a broker reject one) and the position runs
unprotected for the rest of the session with the guard reporting the condition in the log only.
**Fix**:
1. Extract timer arming into `ArmGraceTimer(PositionGuardFsm fsm, Account acct, string instrument)`
   and call it from *every* transition into `Unprotected`, not just FSM creation.
2. Promote `FsmWatchdog` from log-only to remediation: if a FSM has been `Unprotected` past
   `GraceDeadline + StopGuard.WatchdogEscalateSeconds`, re-derive state via the existing
   `SeedFsmsForExistingPositions` logic (refactor it into
   `ReDeriveFsmFromBroker(account, instrument)`), then call `OnGraceExpired`.
3. Borrow REAPER's `_repairInFlight` / `_nakedPositionFirstSeen` pattern: a
   `ConcurrentDictionary<string, DateTime>` keyed by FSM key so escalation fires once per
   naked episode and not once per sweep.
**Test**: position open + stop reaches `Working` → cancel the stop → assert a new grace timer is
armed and `MISSING_STOP_ATTACH` (or `_FLATTEN`) is emitted exactly once.

### P0-2. Auto-stop state is recorded *after* submission and unconditionally
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:2595-2611`
**What happens**:
```csharp
if (stopOrder != null) {
    account.Submit(new[] { stopOrder });
    lock (_stateLock) { ... fsm.State = GuardFsmState.ProtectedPending; }
}
```
Three defects in six lines:
- The `OrderUpdate` for the new stop can arrive **before** the lock is taken, so a stop that
  already reached `Working` (state `Protected`) is regressed to `ProtectedPending`; worse, a stop
  that was **rejected** (state correctly reset to `Unprotected`) is overwritten to
  `ProtectedPending` — and per P0-1 no timer is armed, so the position is naked permanently.
- `stopOrder == null` is a silent no-op: no log, no retry, no flatten fallback.
- The submit itself is not wrapped in try/catch here (the outer `ProcessAction` catches, but the
  FSM is then left in whatever state the pre-submit code left it).
**Fix**: adopt V12's ordering — set `fsm.AutoStopOrder`/`State = ProtectedPending` **under lock
before** `Submit`, then roll back to `Unprotected` + re-arm grace if `CreateOrder` returns null or
`Submit` throws. Never write FSM state from the post-submit path; let `UpdateFsmOnOrder` own it
from there. Add an explicit `AUTO_STOP_SUBMIT_FAILED` event and escalate to
`MISSING_STOP_FLATTEN` after `StopGuard.MaxAutoStopAttempts` (new config, default 2).

### P0-3. Auto-stop quantity is a stale snapshot — can flip the position
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:2508-2597` (uses `action.Quantity`), `ValidateInvariant:2436-2440`
**What happens**: `ExecuteAction` re-reads the live `position` (line 2511) but then sizes the stop
from `action.Quantity`, captured when the action was emitted. `ValidateInvariant` for
`PlaceStopOrder` only checks `InstrumentObj != null && Quantity > 0` — it does not verify that a
position still exists, its side, or its size.
**Impact**: position scaled down between emission and execution → the auto-stop is **larger than
the position**, and when it triggers it opens a **new position in the opposite direction**. Scaled
up → the stop under-covers and part of the position is silently naked.
**Fix**: size from `position.Quantity` at submit time; assert side matches `orderAction`; reject
the action if the position is flat or the side flipped. Tighten `ValidateInvariant` to look up the
live position and confirm the action is genuinely risk-reducing (this is what the "ActionArbiter"
claims to do — see §6 doc drift).

### P0-4. Scale-in keeps `Protected` without checking stop coverage
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1555-1563`
**What happens**: A same-side quantity update updates `PositionQuantity` in place and explicitly
preserves `Protected`/`ProtectedPending`. Nothing compares `RecognizedStopOrder.Quantity` to
`PositionQuantity`, so 1 → 5 contracts with a 1-lot stop still reports fully protected.
**Fix**: add `GuardFsmState.PartiallyProtected` (or a `CoveredQuantity` field, which is less
invasive). On a same-side increase, if covered < position, re-arm the grace timer for the
uncovered delta and emit `MISSING_STOP_ATTACH` sized to the delta. REAPER does the equivalent by
checking stop *quantity* coverage, not mere existence.

### P0-5. Copier exit sizing is not position-mirroring → follower reverses
**Where**: `TradeCopierEngine.cs:401` (`return isExit ? leaderQty : rel.FixedLotSize`),
`427` (`if (isExit) return rawCopyQty;`), consumed at `OnExecution:685-737`
**What happens**: exits are sized from the leader's execution quantity and returned
**unclamped**, never compared to the follower's actual position. In `FixedLot` mode the exit uses
the **leader's raw quantity** and ignores `FixedLotSize` entirely.
**Concrete failure**: `FixedLotSize = 1`. Leader buys 5, follower buys 1. Leader sells 5 →
follower submits `Sell 5` while holding 1 → **follower ends up short 4 contracts** on a market
order, with no stop (P0-9) and no reconciliation (P2-24).
The same happens after any clamp by `MaxPositionSize`, any failed entry copy, or any
micro/mini rounding difference.
**Fix**: route every copy decision through the already-written but **never called**
`CalculateSafeFollowerDelta` (`TradeCopierEngine.cs:165`) — it clamps a reducing delta to
`Math.Abs(currentFollowerQty)` and blocks opposite-side market opens, which is exactly the guard
needed. Target-position mirroring (compute the follower's *desired* position from the leader's
*resulting* position, then submit the delta) is strictly safer than replaying execution
quantities; adopt it.

### P0-6. Micro→Mini conversion floors to 1 contract → 10× notional
**Where**: `TradeCopierEngine.cs:426` — `Math.Max(1, Math.Round(leaderQty * absRatio * symbolMultiplier))`
**What happens**: with `symbolMultiplier = 0.1` (MNQ→NQ), a leader trading 5 MNQ yields
`Math.Max(1, round(0.5))` = **1 NQ = 10 MNQ equivalent**, i.e. 2× intended notional; a leader
trading 1 MNQ yields 1 NQ = **10× intended notional**. Any `QuantityRatio < 1` hits the same floor.
**Fix**: floor to 0 and skip the copy (log `SUB_MINIMUM_SKIPPED`) instead of `Math.Max(1, …)`.
Optionally carry a per-(relationship, instrument) fractional residue accumulator so repeated
sub-1 copies eventually emit one contract. Add a hard notional-parity assertion in tests:
`followerQty × followerPointValue ≈ leaderQty × leaderPointValue × ratio`.

### P0-7. Peak-giveback rule compares incompatible quantities → fires on every profitable flat account
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1154`, predicate at `PropFirmProtectionSuite.cs:104-111`
**What happens**: `EvaluatePeakEquityGiveback(peakOpenGain, currentUnrealized)` is called as
`EvaluatePeakEquityGiveback(stateModel.PeakEquity, stateModel.UnrealizedPnL, …)`.
`PeakEquity` is the peak of **Realized + Unrealized** (`1038-1040`), the second argument is
**Unrealized only**. An account that banked +$2,000 and is now flat gives
`giveback = 2000 - 0 = 2000`, `givebackPct = 1.0 ≥ 0.30` → `PEAK_GIVEBACK_BREACH` →
`FlattenPosition` emitted on **every** `AccountItemUpdate`.
**Impact**: harmless while flat (nothing to flatten), then it instantly flattens the next
position taken after any profitable session. Note this branch deliberately does *not* set
`IsLockedOut`, so it never latches and never stops.
**Fix**: define one basis and use it consistently. Recommended: track `PeakOpenGain` (peak of
unrealized only, reset on flat) and compare against current unrealized; or track
`PeakTotalPnL` and compare against current total. Add a `position != flat` precondition and a
latch so the rule fires once per episode.

### P0-8. The copier is the only order path that bypasses the RiskGuard lockout
**Where**: `TradeCopierEngine.OnExecution:645-737` vs `McpBridgeAddOn.cs:2252`, `2315`, `3966`
**What happens**: every order path in `McpBridgeAddOn` checks
`RiskGuardAddOn.Instance.IsAccountLocked(...)` before submitting. The copier does not. A follower
that RiskGuard has locked out for a daily-loss breach will still receive fresh copied entries;
RiskGuard's lockout sweep then fights the copier — cancel/flatten every 5 s against new entries
arriving on every leader fill.
**Fix**: gate the per-relationship loop on the public API that already exists for this —
`RiskGuardAddOn.Instance.CanTrade(followerName, instrument, "TradeCopier")` (`RiskGuardAddOn.cs:108`)
— and auto-quarantine the relationship (P2-24) when the follower is locked. Also skip copying
*from* a locked leader.

### P0-9. Followers are left naked — no bracket replication
**Where**: `TradeCopierEngine.OnExecution:721-738` (always `OrderType.Market`, no protective legs);
`EnableFollowerAtm` / `FollowerAtmStrategyName` are carried between DTOs (`:91`, `:36-37`) and
**never read**
**What happens**: followers receive bare market orders. Their only protection is RiskGuard's
`StopAttachSeconds` grace → `RiskGuardAutoStop` at a fixed tick offset from *average price*
(`RiskGuardAddOn.cs:2545`), which bears no relation to the leader's actual stop. If RiskGuard is
disarmed, in shadow mode, or the follower is in `ExcludedAccounts`, there is no stop at all.
**Fix** (in preference order):
1. Replicate the leader's protective legs: on leader stop/target `OrderUpdate`, mirror them to
   followers scaled by the same quantity function, anchored to the **follower's own fill** (V12
   Symmetry Guard pattern) rather than the leader's price.
2. Failing that, implement `EnableFollowerAtm` by submitting a fixed bracket at copy time
   (V12 "Path B") using a stop distance derived from the leader's stop, with
   `SlippageCushionPoints`-style padding so follower dollar risk ≤ the configured cap.
3. Minimum bar: refuse to copy to a follower unless RiskGuard is armed, live, and subscribed to
   that account — fail closed, log `COPY_BLOCKED_NO_GUARD`.

## 2. P1 — Concurrency and invariant violations

### P1-10. The safety sweep holds `_stateLock` across broker calls
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1336-1446` — the `lock (_stateLock)` block contains
`account.Cancel` (1413), `account.Flatten` (1423), `account.Submit` (1429) and
`ProcessAction(...)` (1439), which itself calls `ExecuteAction` → `Flatten`/`Cancel`/`Submit`.
**Why it matters**: [RiskGuardAddOn.md](RiskGuardAddOn.md) §5 and §6.7 both state the invariant
"deadlocks are avoided by yielding the lock before calling NinjaTrader's `Flatten` or `Cancel`".
The event paths honour it correctly (`ExecutePositionUpdateDetails:905-913` collects actions under
lock and processes them after release). The sweep does not. Because the sweep runs on the WPF
dispatcher via `InvokeAsync` (`1320`), any NT8 internal path that blocks on a background thread
which in turn needs `_stateLock` deadlocks the UI thread — and with it the guard.
**Fix**: restructure the sweep to the same collect-then-execute shape as the event handlers.
Nothing inside `lock` may call into `Account`.

### P1-11. Lockout sweep cancels protective stops and reducing orders
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1410-1414`
```csharp
var toCancel = account.Orders.Where(o => o.OrderState != OrderState.Filled
                                      && o.OrderState != OrderState.Cancelled).ToList();
account.Cancel(toCancel);
```
This cancels **everything non-terminal** — including the protective stop covering the position it
is about to flatten, and including position-reducing orders that §6.10 of the design doc
explicitly promises to preserve (`IsPositionReducingOrder` is honoured in `OnOrderUpdate` but not
here). If the subsequent `Flatten` fails (the code catches and falls back to a market order,
which can also fail), the account is left with a position and **no stop**.
**Fix**: order of operations — (a) cancel only *entry / risk-increasing* working orders, (b)
flatten, (c) cancel the remainder after confirming flat. Reuse `RiskGuardOrderUtils.IsPositionReducingOrder`
and `IsProtectiveSide`. Add an attempt counter with escalation to a loud alert after N cycles
instead of silent infinite retry (REAPER's `_reaperFlattenInFlight` + grace pattern).

### P1-12. Blocking file I/O under the global lock
**Where**: heartbeat `File.WriteAllText` (`1342`), log `File.AppendAllLines` (`1351`),
`SavePersistedState()` (`1395`) — all inside `lock (_stateLock)`; plus
`SavePersistedState()` called **synchronously on every position change** at `865`.
**Why it matters**: `_stateLock` is the same lock every NT8 event handler needs. A slow disk
stalls order-event processing. The `_stateDirty` batching mechanism already exists and is used by
the sweep — line 865 bypasses it.
**Fix**: replace line 865 with `_stateDirty = true`. Move all file writes outside the lock;
consider a dedicated writer thread draining `_logQueue`.

### P1-13. Guard evaluation runs on the WPF dispatcher
**Where**: `OnSafetySweep:1317-1323`, `UpdateFsmOnPosition:1599-1604`, `SeedFsms…:501-507`
**Why it matters**: safety-critical latency is coupled to UI responsiveness. V12 does the
inverse — REAPER audits on a background thread and marshals *only* the order-submitting calls to
the strategy thread via `TriggerCustomEvent`.
**Fix**: evaluate on the timer's own thread; marshal only `Account.Flatten/Cancel/Submit` to the
dispatcher. This also removes the "no dispatcher → silently return" failure mode at `1318`,
where the entire sweep is skipped if `Application.Current` is null.

### P1-14. `_pendingStops` is single-slot, unbounded in lifetime, and side-blind
**Where**: `UpdateFsmOnOrder:1651-1658`, consumed at `UpdateFsmOnPosition:1577-1587`
- `_pendingStops[key] = order` keeps **one** order per (account, instrument) — a bracket with
  multiple stop legs, or a second stop arriving first, overwrites the first.
- Entries are only removed on consumption or on flat. A buffered stop for a position that never
  materialises (entry rejected) leaks and can be consumed by a *later, unrelated* position on the
  same instrument.
- The comment admits the side is unknown at buffer time, so a **stop-market entry order** (a
  breakout entry, exactly what V12's OR mode submits) is buffered as a candidate protective stop.
**Fix**: `Dictionary<string, List<Order>>` with a TTL (e.g. `StopAttachSeconds × 2`), swept in the
watchdog; classify by side on consumption only, and require `order.Quantity <= positionQuantity`.

### P1-15. Re-arming does not seed FSMs for open positions
**Where**: `ToggleArmed:2231-2249`; `SeedFsmsForExistingPositions` is only called from
`SubscribeToAccount`
**What happens**: `UpdateFsmOnPosition`/`UpdateFsmOnOrder` return early when `!_isArmed`
(`1547`, `1645`). Disarm → open a position → re-arm, and there is no FSM, no grace timer, and no
protection until the position changes side.
**Fix**: call `SeedFsmsForExistingPositions` for every subscribed account inside `ToggleArmed`
when transitioning to armed. Same on `SaveAndReloadConfig`/`ReloadConfig` if
`ExcludedAccounts` shrank.

### P1-30. FSM teardown cancels the orphan auto-stop while the caller holds `_stateLock`
*(found during T1 implementation, 2026-08-06 — a P1-10 site this review originally missed)*
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1620` inside `UpdateFsmOnPosition`'s nonflat→flat branch:
`try { account.Cancel(new[] { fsm.AutoStopOrder }); }`
**What happens**: `UpdateFsmOnPosition` is only ever called with `_stateLock` held — from
`ExecutePositionUpdateDetails:880` and from `TestFsmOnPosition`. So the orphan-auto-stop
cancellation is a broker call under the global lock, exactly the invariant §5/§6.7 of the design
doc claims is never violated. P1-10 catalogued the sweep as the only offender; this is a second,
independent site on the hot event path.
**Fix**: fold into P1-10's collect-then-execute restructuring — queue the orphan order on a
pending-cancel list and drain it in `ExecutePositionUpdateDetails` after the lock is released,
alongside the existing `ProcessAction` loop. Do not add a separate drain mechanism.

### P1-31. Coverage tracking follows a single stop order, so two partial stops read as under-covered
*(found during T1 review, 2026-08-06)*
**Where**: `PositionGuardFsm.RecognizedStopOrder` / the new `CoveredQuantity` (T1)
**What happens**: the FSM tracks exactly one protective stop. A trader covering a 6-lot position
with two working 3-lot stops leaves `CoveredQuantity = 3`, so the under-coverage rule introduced by
T1 fires and attaches a 3-lot auto-stop — total protective quantity 9 on a 6-lot position, which
flips the position when the stops trigger. T1 deliberately scopes this out (it clamps the emitted
action to the uncovered delta computed from one stop), so the defect is narrowed but not closed.
**Fix**: aggregate coverage across all non-terminal protective-side stop orders for the
`(account, instrument)` pair rather than tracking a single `Order` reference — i.e. replace
`RecognizedStopOrder` with a small list, and compute `CoveredQuantity` as the sum. This is the
same computation the P3-30 reconciler needs, so build it once and share it.

---

## 3. P1 — Rule semantics

### P1-16. `ConsecutiveLosses` over-counts on partial exits
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1008-1014` — every negative delta in `RealizedProfitLoss`
increments the counter.
One trade closed in three partials at a loss = **3 consecutive losses**. §6.9 of the design doc
introduced flat-transition debouncing for `TradesToday` but not for this counter, so the two
disagree about what a "trade" is.
**Fix**: attribute realized-PnL deltas to the trade lifecycle already tracked by
`PositionState.LastFlatTransition`; evaluate win/loss once per flat transition.

### P1-17. Evaluation profit target is fed session-scoped PnL
**Where**: `RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1139` passes `stateModel.RealizedPnL`, which is
`raw - SessionStartRealizedPnL` (`1006`) and reset daily (`1376`).
`EvaluationTargetProfit` ($3,000 default) is a **cumulative** prop-firm evaluation target.
**Fix**: track `CumulativeRealizedPnL` in `PersistedStateData` (survives restarts) and feed that;
keep the session value for the daily-loss rule.

### P1-18. Two overlapping trailing-drawdown implementations
`EvaluatePnLRules` enforces `profile.TrailingDrawdown` against a **session-reset** `PeakEquity`
(`1101-1118`, reset to 0 at `1370`), while `EvaluateFirmMirror` (`2688`) implements the firm's
real trailing-DD model with `FirmTrailingDDConfig`. For Apex-style accounts the high-water mark
does **not** reset daily, so the first rule is either redundant or wrong depending on config.
**Fix**: make `FirmMirror` authoritative when `FirmMirror.Enabled`; skip the profile-level
trailing-DD rule in that case and document the precedence in the design doc.

### P1-19. Actions are neither deduplicated nor instrument-scoped
- A single `EvaluatePnLRules` pass can append `DAILY_LOSS_BREACH`, `TRAILING_DD_BREACH`,
  `NEWS_SHIELD_LOCKOUT`, `EVALUATION_TARGET_REACHED` and `PEAK_GIVEBACK_BREACH` — five
  `FlattenPosition` actions, each of which independently walks all positions and calls
  `account.Flatten` (`2450-2483`).
- `ExecuteAction`'s `FlattenPosition` **ignores `action.Instrument`** and flattens every
  instrument on the account, including instruments that only have working orders (`2460-2469`).
  A missing stop on MES therefore flattens MNQ too.
**Fix**: coalesce actions by `(AccountName, ActionType, Instrument)` before processing; honour
`action.Instrument` when set and only fall back to account-wide for lockout/panic rules.

### P1-20. Weak simulated-account detection gates the live safety switch
**Where**: `TradeCopierEngine.cs:650` — `followerAcc.Name.StartsWith("Sim", …)`
An account named e.g. `SimplyApex-01` is treated as simulated and **bypasses the
`ArmedForLive` gate** (`653-657`).
**Fix**: test the connection/provider (`account.Connection?.Options?.Provider == Provider.Simulator`),
not the name. Fail closed if the provider cannot be determined.

### P1-21. Copier never re-subscribes to accounts that connect later
**Where**: `McpBridgeAddOn.cs:252-258` — `Account.All` is enumerated once at `State.Configure`.
RiskGuard handles this correctly via `Connection.ConnectionStatusUpdate`
(`RiskGuardAddOn.cs:296`, `OnConnectionStatusUpdate:770`).
**Fix**: mirror RiskGuard's pattern for `ExecutionUpdate` subscription, and unsubscribe on
disconnect to avoid duplicate handlers.

### P1-22. No slippage/latency control on copies
Everything is `OrderType.Market` with no reference to the leader's fill price, no maximum
acceptable slippage, and no latency measurement — while `LatencyMs` and `AvgSlippageTicks` are
displayed in the UI (`TradeCopierWindow.cs:799`) as if they were real.
**Fix**: record `exec.Time` → follower fill time to populate `LatencyMs`; compute realised
slippage in ticks vs the leader fill; add `MaxSlippageTicks` per relationship that quarantines
the relationship when exceeded; consider limit-with-offset instead of pure market for entries.

### P1-23. Symbol translation and sizing modes are partly cosmetic
- `TranslateSymbol` (`:360-395`) uses global `rawSymbol.Replace(symbol, target)` rather than a
  prefix substitution — fragile against any symbol appearing inside the expiry portion.
- `CopierSizingMode.NetLiquidationRatio`, `AvailableCashPercent` and `PerTickerMatrix` are
  declared (`:19`) but **not implemented** in `CalculateFollowerQuantity`; they silently degrade
  to `QuantityRatio`.
**Fix**: replace `Replace` with root-symbol substitution on the parsed root; either implement the
three sizing modes or remove them from the enum and the UI so the config cannot lie.

## 4. P2 — Dead safety code, unreachable features, and stated-vs-actual gaps

### P2-24. Written-but-never-called safety machinery
| Symbol | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `CalculateSafeFollowerDelta` | TradeCopierEngine.cs:165 | never called — the fix for P0-5 already exists |
| `ReconcileFollowerPosition` | TradeCopierEngine.cs:194 | never called — the REAPER-equivalent desync repair |
| `IsQuarantined` | :326, :342 | read as a filter, **never set** by the engine on error |
| `DailyLossLimit` | :40, :501 | parsed, persisted, surfaced in the UI, **never enforced** |
| `EnableFollowerAtm` / `FollowerAtmStrategyName` | :36-37, :91 | copied between DTOs, never read |
| `LatencyMs` / `AvgSlippageTicks` | :43-44 | displayed in the UI, never computed |
| `StealthMode` | :38 | persisted, never read |

**Fix**: wire each one or delete it. Priority order: `CalculateSafeFollowerDelta` (P0-5),
`ReconcileFollowerPosition` (schedule it on a periodic reconciler — see P3-30), automatic
quarantine on submit exception / risk breach, then `DailyLossLimit` enforcement per relationship.
Config that is displayed but not enforced is worse than absent config — it invites a live
account to be armed on the belief that a limit is active.

### P2-25. The news shield can never fire in production
**Where**: `PropFirmProtectionSuite.cs:51` (`_newsEvents`), populated **only** by
`AddTestNewsEvent` (`:55`). `LocalNewsEventsFilePath` (`:36`) is parsed and persisted but never
read. `IsInNewsWindow` therefore always returns `false` outside tests, so the
`NEWS_SHIELD_LOCKOUT` branch (`RiskGuardAddOn.cs:1124`) is unreachable.
Also unimplemented: `EnableConsistencyCap` / `MaxDailyProfitPctOfTarget` / `EnableAutoDayFiller`
(parsed, never evaluated).
**Fix**: load events from `LocalNewsEventsFilePath` on config load and refresh periodically.
This repo already has an economic-calendar pipeline —
[ECONOMIC_CALENDAR_ARCHITECTURE.md](ECONOMIC_CALENDAR_ARCHITECTURE.md) — so the correct move is
to emit a JSON feed from it into the path the suite reads, not to build a second source.

### P2-26. Design-doc drift ([RiskGuardAddOn.md](RiskGuardAddOn.md))
| Doc claim | Code reality |
|---|---|
| §5, §6.5, §6.8: "1-second sweep" / "1-second `DispatcherTimer`" | `new Timer(OnSafetySweep, null, 5000, 5000)` — 5 s, `System.Threading.Timer` (`:303`) |
| §3 data-flow diagram: sweep → `EvaluateRules` | sweep no longer calls `EvaluateRules` (`:1448-1453`) |
| §6.5: sweep keeps aggregate sizing, firm-mirror, grace-expiry polling | all three moved to event handlers (`:889`, `:1048`) / per-FSM timers; sweep keeps only heartbeat, log flush, session reset, persist, lockout watchdog, FSM watchdog |
| §5, §6.7: "lock released before `Flatten`/`Cancel`" | violated by the sweep (P1-10) |
| §6.7: `EvaluateGraceExpiry` "called from a per-FSM Timer or the sweep" (code comment `:1708-1710`) | sweep never calls it — the "defensive" path does not exist |
| §9.1: "Automatic relationship quarantine on execution error or risk limit breach" | not implemented (P2-24) |
| §9.3: news / target / giveback "auto-lockout, auto-flatten" | news unreachable (P2-25); giveback mis-wired (P0-7); target semantics wrong (P1-17) |
| §2, §4, §8: "87 unit tests" / "84 comprehensive test methods" / "60 original + 24 FSM" in the same document | reconcile against an actual test run |
**Fix**: the doc is the artifact most likely to cause a wrong decision under pressure. Update it
in the same commit as each code change, and add a doc-drift check to the test harness (assert the
sweep interval constant matches the documented value).

### P2-27. The riskiest code has zero test coverage
`TradeCopierEngine.OnExecution` (`:613-745`) and `ReconcileFollowerPosition` (`:193-228`) are
inside `#if !TESTING`, so the entire copy path is excluded from `RiskGuardTests.csproj`. The same
applies to all real order submission in `RiskGuardAddOn.ExecuteAction`. The 4,237-line
`RiskGuardAddOnTests.cs` is a hand-rolled `Main`-plus-`Assert` console app with no CI job.
**Fix** — borrow V12's `PureLogic` split:
1. Extract the decision math into an NT8-free static class (`CopierSizingLogic`,
   `StopGuardDecisionLogic`) taking primitives/DTOs, with **no `#if`** — target position, delta,
   notional parity, stop price/side/quantity, coverage checks.
2. Keep `OnExecution`/`ExecuteAction` as thin submission shells over those functions.
3. Extend the stub `Account` (`TestingStubs.cs`) with a recording `Submit`/`Cancel`/`Flatten` so
   the submission shells become testable too.
4. Add a GitHub Actions job (`dotnet run --project ninjatrader-addon/RiskGuardTests.csproj`)
   with a non-zero exit on failure — the harness currently has to be run by hand.

### P2-28. Three divergent copies of the addon sources + committed build output
- `scripts/ninjatrader/addons/` — canonical (referenced by `ninjatrader-addon/RiskGuardTests.csproj`)
- `scripts/strategies/nt8/addons_DONOTUSE/RiskGuardAddOn.cs` — **different md5**, still present
- `mcp/ninjatrader-mcp/nt8-addon/` — partial copy (`RiskGuardAddOnTests.cs` is a hard link;
  `DynamicAtmManager.cs` / `TestingStubs.cs` are separate copies)
- `ninjatrader-addon/bin/`, `obj/`, and a committed `RiskGuardTests.exe`
**Fix**: adopt V12's `deploy-sync.ps1` idea — one source of truth in `scripts/ninjatrader/addons/`
hard-linked into `Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\AddOns\`, delete `addons_DONOTUSE`, replace
the `mcp/` copies with links, and gitignore `bin/`/`obj/`/`*.exe`. Record the layout in
[NT8_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md](NT8_FILE_ORGANIZATION.md).

### P2-29. Single-file size / complexity
`RiskGuardAddOn.cs` is 4,108 lines including a ~700-line WPF window (`RiskGuardWindow`,
`:3389-4096`); `McpBridgeAddOn.cs` is 5,452. V12 solved the same problem by splitting one
`partial class` across 71 files by concern and gating complexity in CI.
**Fix**: split into `RiskGuardAddOn.{Core,Fsm,Rules,Actions,FirmMirror,Persistence,Ui}.cs` as
`partial class`, and move `RiskGuardWindow`/`CardControls` to their own files. Optionally port
`scripts/complexity_audit.py` from the baseline repo as a pre-commit metric.

## 5. P3 — Architecture upgrades worth porting from V12

### P3-30. An independent reconciler (the REAPER port) — highest-value single addition
Today both addons trust their own in-memory model. V12's REAPER assumes the model is wrong and
re-derives truth from the broker every cycle. Build one auditor serving both addons:

```
RiskGuardReconciler (background thread, 1-2 s)
  for each subscribed account:
    broker truth  := account.Positions + account.Orders
    expected      := AccountState + _guardFsms  (+ copier target positions)
    detect:
      - naked position          (position != flat, no non-terminal covering stop >= qty)
      - partially covered       (stop qty < position qty)
      - orphan stop             (working stop, no position)
      - FSM/broker divergence   (FSM says Protected, broker has no stop)
      - copier desync           (follower position != f(leader position))
    remediate (marshaled to the order thread, deduped by in-flight dictionary,
               each with its own grace window):
      - attach stop | flatten | cancel orphan | re-derive FSM | quarantine relationship
```
Reuse what exists: `SeedFsmsForExistingPositions` is already a correct re-derivation routine, and
`ReconcileFollowerPosition` is already a correct follower repair — both just need to be called
from here. Borrow REAPER's `_repairInFlight` / `_nakedPositionFirstSeen` grace pattern so a
normal bracket-confirmation window is not mistaken for a naked position.

### P3-31. Expected-position ledger with reserve/rollback
V12 registers the master's expected position **before** submitting and rolls the reservation back
if the submit returns null. Adopting this fixes P0-2 structurally and gives the reconciler a
precise "expected vs actual" to compare, instead of inferring intent from order names.

### P3-32. Follower risk anchored to the follower's own fill
V12's Symmetry Guard resolves an `AnchorSnapshot` from the master's weighted fill and sizes
followers with a `SlippageCushionPoints` reserve so follower dollar risk cannot exceed the cap
even on a worse fill. Our copier has no equivalent. Minimum viable version: after the follower
fill, compute realised dollar risk from the follower's actual fill and the mirrored stop; if it
exceeds the relationship cap, reduce the position immediately rather than at the next evaluation.

### P3-33. Replace the global lock on the hot path
V12 enforces zero `lock()` via an `Enqueue(ctx => …)` actor model, so no event handler can ever
block another. A full port is large; the pragmatic subset is: keep `_stateLock` for state
mutation only, never hold it across I/O or broker calls (P1-10/12), and move the action queue to
a `ConcurrentQueue<GuardAction>` drained by a single executor.

### P3-34. Arm/shadow discipline extended to the copier
RiskGuard's `RunPreflight` + `MinShadowSessions` gate is the best-designed safety feature in
either addon. The copier only has a per-relationship `ArmedForLive` bool with a name-based sim
check (P1-20). Give the copier the same treatment: a global arm switch, a shadow mode that logs
intended follower orders without submitting, and a preflight that verifies every follower is
connected, subscribed, not locked, and has a resolvable instrument.

## 6. Execution order

Phases are ordered so that nothing depends on later work, and so live-risk defects land first.

| Phase | Content | Gate to exit |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Foundation** | P2-28 (one source of truth, deploy-sync, gitignore), P2-27 steps 1-4 (extract NT8-free logic classes, recording stubs, CI job) | CI runs the harness on push; all existing tests pass |
| **1. RiskGuard naked-risk** | P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, P0-4 | New tests: stop-cancelled-mid-position re-arms; submit failure rolls back; auto-stop sized from live qty; scale-in flagged partially covered |
| **2. Copier sizing/gating** | P0-5, P0-6, P0-8, P0-9 (option 3 minimum) | Notional-parity test; exit-clamp test (leader 5 / follower 1 → follower flat, never short); locked-follower copy blocked |
| **3. Rule semantics** | P0-7, P1-16, P1-17, P1-18, P1-19 | Profitable-flat-account emits no giveback action; 3-partial loss counts as 1; instrument-scoped flatten does not touch other instruments |
| **4. Concurrency** | P1-10, P1-11, P1-12, P1-13, P1-14, P1-15, **P1-30**, **P1-31** | No `Account.*` call inside any `lock (_stateLock)` (grep gate, mirroring V12's lock audit); sweep runs off the dispatcher; coverage aggregates across all protective stops |
| **5. Reconciler** | P3-30, plus wiring P2-24 (`ReconcileFollowerPosition`, auto-quarantine, `DailyLossLimit`) | Sim stress: manual stop cancel, manual naked position, follower desync — each repaired within one grace window |
| **6. Copier fidelity** | P0-9 (options 1-2), P1-20, P1-21, P1-22, P1-23, P3-32 | Follower brackets present on every copy; latency/slippage populated from real fills |
| **7. Cleanup** | P2-25 (calendar feed), P2-26 (doc reconciliation), P2-29 (file split), P3-31, P3-33, P3-34 | Design doc matches code; drift assertion in tests |

### Validation protocol (every phase)
1. Unit tests on the extracted NT8-free logic first — no live NT8 needed.
2. `shadow` mode on Sim accounts for the whole phase; diff intended vs actual actions in
   `interventions.jsonl`.
3. Adversarial Sim scenarios, run against the live bridge (extend
   `tmp/comprehensive_stress_test.ps1`): cancel a stop under an open position; reject a stop
   (invalid price); scale in past stop coverage; flatten the leader while a follower copy is
   in flight; lock a follower mid-session; disconnect a follower mid-copy; disarm and re-arm with
   positions open; kill NT8 with positions open and restart.
4. Only then flip `ArmedForLive` on a single live micro account with minimum size.

### Non-goals for this plan
- No port of V12's Photon SPSC ring / MMIO mirror. Our latency budget (HTTP bridge, 5 s sweep)
  is orders of magnitude above where zero-allocation ring buffers matter; adopting them would add
  risk, not remove it.
- No adoption of V12's entry logic (OR/RMA/MOMO/TREND/FFMA) — different problem domain.
- No move to `Account.All` iteration inside a strategy (V12's SIMA model). Our addon-based
  design is the right choice for copying trades placed by hand or by other strategies.
