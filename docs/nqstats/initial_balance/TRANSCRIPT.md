(00:01) [Music] Hey, how's it going? Before we get into this video, INQ Stats does not provide strategy. It does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice. What INQ Stats does do is provide statistical edge derived from historical market performance. Nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind.
(00:29) This video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision. You, as the trader, are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter, exit, and manage any trade you decide to take. With that said, let's get into it. All right, how's it going? Uh, this video is going to be on the initial initial balance breaks.
(00:50) That was uh one of the next ones that got voted in as what people wanted to see next. So, this video is going to be on initial balance breaks. Uh real quick just to bring in the stats. Uh initial balance breaks looks to see how often historically price breaks the initial bounce high or lower overall total initial balance is calculated by the 9:30 a.m.
(01:13) to 10:30 a.m. highs and lows. So, as the highs and lows form between that 1 hour block of 9:30 a.m. Eastern to 10:30 a.m. Eastern, you're looking to see um if you're going to break out of that that box. It'll make a little bit more sense once we check it out on the chart. Um so, as far as stats go, initial balance breaks before New York session ends.
(01:36) So, the 4pm end. Um here's your stats for that. You can see we have about a 96% probability historically over the last 10 years. uh this sample goes from 2014 to 2024. So about a 96% probability uh that we break that box and then but what about before noon? So before noon there is an 83% probability still high and uh we'll go ahead and look at the chart.
(02:05) So how that looks on the chart is you're going into your uh New York session. Um this today's session market's currently active live. We'll go to a prior day. So, you're going into your New York session 9:30 opens and you have highs and lows that form within that initial balance time window of 1 hour. And then the probability there's your noon line.
(02:31) So, the probability is that either this high or this low is going to break uh roughly 96% of the time before noon. And then as you approach noon and let's just say price chopped around, you know, set the high and then something did like something like that. Um, now it it will break this high or this low 96% of the time before the end of the New York session.
(03:04) Now before the noon timeline, that is where you come in to the 83% probability. So, let's see if we can find a day just over the last recent PA to where we didn't break before noon. Usually happens before noon, but see if I can find one that did not. That was before noon. Before noon, before before, excuse me. All these are before. Um, having a really hard time finding one that didn't happen before noon.
(03:41) All right, there you go. There's There's one. So, I had to scroll back quite a quite a ways to find one, but here's one. So, we had 9:30 New York open uh form that high and then start trending down to form the low and then that 10:30 window closes and then price chops around inside that range until noon.
(04:06) uh once we hit the noon line, the probability then shifts from a 96 or a uh 83% probability of breaking this high or this low to now a 96% probability. So before before noon, we had an 83% probability of breaking this higher low. Now that we're at noon going into that PM session, the probability increases because there's more time involved.
(04:30) Now total we have a 96% probability that the higher low will break and we end up breaking around that 1230 mark breaks the high trends down and then breaks the high again before trending up into the into the PM. Um that is the probability that is how it looks on a chart. Now how can you use this? Um you can use this in a couple different ways, right? You can use this to control much much similar to the noon curve.
(04:56) That was the last video made if you haven't seen the noon curve video. Uh I suggest you go watch that video because that video is is somewhat similar to this video. It involves a time box. It involves highs and lows. It involves breaking those highs and lows. And uh it's rather similar. Uh so how would you use the initial balance break? Let's say you're in a trade.
(05:17) We'll go look at today. Um well, that kind of took it right to the end. So, it it breaks, but it's not a good example of of uh being in something. All right, here's a good example. So, let's say you're, you know, you you're in the markets. Um, where'd that go? Let's say you're in the markets. You know, 9:30 opens, it comes down.
(05:41) You know, you're you're taking price into consideration, and maybe you've already entered a trade. Uh, you know, you're short up here and and price is trending down. And when we take into consideration where's the 50% of this range there's the 50%. So as price trades down, if we close the initial balance in the bottom half of that initial balance time window, it is most likely that we will break the low.
(06:16) If we closed the initial balance, like let's say, you know, price opened up and you know, we we closed that initial balance time window in the upper half, it would be more likely that we would break the high. That's that's not a probability. I mean, I'm sure there's probability attached to that.
(06:32) I I don't have I don't track the probability of that. I can just see it daily that if we close into that initial balance time window in the bottom half, it is most likely that we will break the low. If we close that initial balance time window in the upper half, it's most likely that we'll break the high.
(06:52) Now coming into this bottom let's say you were already short and you wanted to you know you had lower targets uh you you can assume that you might start seeing price trade lower. Uh that is the noon line. So again, we have a 86% probability that we'll break that low before the noon line and we price ends up breaking that low before noon.
(07:18) And then you have the noon curve, right? So if you factor in the noon curve as well, here is the low set pre- noon. So this is your pre- noon low uh right here. And then your post noon low. So you end up making a lower low and then price continues to drop throughout that session. But um that is the probability that is how it looks on a chart. Now how can you use this? Um you can use this in a couple different ways, right? You can use this to control much much similar to the noon curve.
(07:48) Now let's say you were not in a trade. Uh we'll just go back to a different example, a different day, right? So scroll back to some some different price. We'll just go back way back here. I don't even know what day this is, but we'll we'll look at this day. All right, so coming into this day would happen to be January 31st.
(08:11) Uh, so going into January 31st, New York open sets the low, comes up, sets the high, and closes it out right about there. Um, now I don't know what your entry model is or how you trade, but let's say that there's some type of long that you took somewhere in here perhaps. Um, that is that is a good place to be long because we close initial balance in the upper half of the initial balance time window.
(08:46) Uh, so initial balance closed out at 10:30. closed out and when it closed out in 10:30, we're in the upper half of that initial balance box. So, it is probable to assume that the high of that box will be broken. So, if you took a long somewhere in this pullback, you now have a a good chance that that high is going to be broke.
(09:13) um what what you do with that trade, you know, going forward, if you take it up higher, whatever higher time frame targets you might have, that's totally dependent on your strategy. Uh but from a probability perspective, you then had a probability of breaking that high and a likelihood that it was going to be the high.
(09:30) So, you know that there is a 86% probability that you're going to break that high or that low before noon. and you know that it is most likely to be the high if you closed the initial balance gap in the upper half is most likely to be the high. Uh I've never put stats on that like I said but actually that might be something that I'll I'll add.
(09:54) So I'll go ahead and add that to the site uh just to to show how often if you close in that first half uh how often it it breaks the high versus if you close in the lower half, how often it breaks the low. Um, I'll add that to the site. But I can tell you just from prior experience that in the first in in the upper half breaks the high and the lower half breaks the low most of the time.
(10:16) Um, going into one more final example. This is pretty simple stat, so I don't think there's a whole lot to to go into with this, but I'll just look for another example there. There breaks the low. Uh, all right. So, here's like a good example of a noon break. Um, you set the low, initial bounce low, initial bounce high.
(10:41) Price drops around a bit inside doesn't break before noon. So, you had an 86% probability that it breaks before noon, but now we're adding more time because it didn't break before noon. We're taking it out to 400 p.m. close all the way over here. Uh, oops. Yeah, we're taking it all the way over to here.
(11:04) So now that we've added all those additional additional hours, our probability increases to 96%. And you can see after the first minute after noon, we end up breaking that high. Um so again, this can help you with bias. This can help you with expectation of an existing trade. It can keep you out of trades.
(11:24) Um let's say that you're in this exact day and price opens up and we drop down. We come up and we set the high and initial balance closes. This is probably not somewhere you want to short yet. Uh it's not to say that price won't go down throughout the rest of the day, but it's probably not somewhere you want to short just yet knowing that there is a high probability that that high gets broken.
(11:48) So maybe you might want to wait a little bit. You know, see the high get broken and then once the high is broken, you're considering looking for shorts. Um that might be something that you want to do. And in this day, it just kept grinding up higher. Uh, so it would have kept you out of a premature short. Let's see if there's another day real quick.
(12:08) So, here's a good good prime example of a avoidance, right? So, 9:30 opens, we set the low pretty much right off the bat. Go up, midpoint, back down for initial bounce high. Initial bounce closes out pretty much at the peak of the time box. Very next candle breaks it. So it's not you're you're not immediately looking to short in this price action.
(12:35) So as you're coming up to close out the initial balance, this is not all of this is not somewhere where you're looking to short. All of this right here, this is not somewhere where you're looking to short because initial balance hasn't closed yet and you're also in the upper half of that box. So you can expect initial balance to break the high.
(12:56) So, you would wait for the high to break and then you would start looking for shorts. Um, and that's exactly how this panned out. So, prime prime example of waiting for initial bounce to close, waiting for the high break, and then looking for shorts. I hope this video is helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.
