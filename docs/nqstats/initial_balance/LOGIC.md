# Initial Balance (IB) Breaks Logic

**Source**: NQStats "Initial Balance Breaks" Video Transcript
**Concept**: Probabilities of price breaking the Initial Balance (09:30-10:30 ET Range) High or Low.

## 1. Definitions
*   **Initial Balance (IB)**: The High and Low established between **09:30 AM** and **10:30 AM** ET.
*   **Noon Line**: 12:00 PM ET.
*   **Close**: 16:00 PM ET.

## 2. The Core Stats
*   **Break Today (Before 16:00)**: **~96%** probability that the IB High OR IB Low will be broken before the session ends.
*   **Break Before Noon**: **~83-86%** probability that the break happens before 12:00 PM.

## 3. Directional Bias (The "Close" Rule)
*   **Upper Half Close**: If the 10:30 AM candle closes in the **Upper 50%** of the Initial Balance range -> **High Probability of breaking IB High**.
*   **Lower Half Close**: If the 10:30 AM candle closes in the **Lower 50%** of the Initial Balance range -> **High Probability of breaking IB Low**.

## 4. Operational Strategy
*   **Context**: At 10:30 AM, mark the High and Low.
*   **Check Position**: Ideally, price is not "done" inside the range.
*   **Bias**: Use the "Close Rule" to determine direction.
*   **Timing**: Expect the break before Noon (86% chance). If it stays inside until Noon, the probability of a break in the PM session increases to ~96% (compressed spring).
*   **Avoidance**: Do not short *inside* the IB if price closed in the Upper Half (expecting a High break). Do not long *inside* if price closed in the Lower Half.
