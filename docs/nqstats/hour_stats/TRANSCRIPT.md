(00:11) hey how's it going before we get into this video inq stats does not provide strategy it does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice what inq stats does do is provide statistical Edge derived from historical market performance nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind this video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision you as the trader are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter exit and
(00:37) manage any trade you decide to take with that said let's get into it all right let's get into this first video I took a poll on the inq stats X feed and it looks like the most popular stat that everybody liked from the library was the hour stats this first ever video is going to be covering the hour stats uh so what is the hour stats um all right to make this Fair let's go and pick a random date over the last year that way you know nobody can say Hey you Cherry Picked it where it worked so let's go current today is 9 March 2025 we'll go
(01:11) back to 9 March 2024 we'll look for just one day through Monday through Friday we'll get date that's going to give us um the sixth of March of this year okay that's that's relatively recent price action let's let's try again to make it a little more um random a little more fair so we hit get date again all right there we go let's get out of this month let's go back a little bit get another date maybe something from last year all right there we go um September 6th so we'll take the chart starting with a one minute chart
(01:47) we'll take the chart back to September 6th uh this is a Friday all right so boom fast forward to a Friday now here's the first hour all right so going into this first 8 AM hour all right NQ stats it's based off of Prior hour so The 8 amm Hour what it's saying is is if the 8 am. Hour takes the 7 A.M hour High historically over the last 10 years there's a 75% probability that price will trade back to the ADM open now if you break that down into 20 minute segments you'll see that the first if that sweep happens in the first 20
(02:29) minutes there's a 89% probability that price will come back to the 8 hour open now as you further progress throughout that that uh hour the probability reduces and furthermore if you scroll down you'll see you know where the highs form and where the lows typically form so if you get an 8 A.M hour High sweep 35% of the time historically that has set the high of the bar as well as um the low of the bar 35% of the time if you look at where the lowest form 37 36 that middle portion is not high probability other than the 9 A.M hour um
(03:09) look at the 9:00 a.m. hour so when you look at how a candle forms and how a candle opens up you'll typically have you know an open and then a high and then a low and then a close or maybe it might go open low high close now that first if we look at you know TimeWise something like that right you'll have your first 20 minutes your second 20 minutes and your third 20 minutes so what it's stating is that that first 20 minutes and that last 20 minutes is typically where the highs and lows form that middle 20 minutes the highs and
(03:48) lows aren't usually forming there that's where your expansion occurs and it makes sense from a from a candle perspective where you have a low expansion to a high and then a close now the only caveat to that is the 9:00 a.m. hour because we have the 9:30 equities open so a lot of times what you might see with the 9:30 equities open is you might see something like you know it opens it comes down it trades up and then the 9930 volatility just goes bam and then you run up set the high and close something like that
(04:21) that happens a lot that is why the statistic is showing at the first 20 minutes typically does not set the higher the low It's usually the middle 20 minutes in the last 20 minutes but getting back to the topic at hand here uh this 8 a.m. hour it's not it's not an ideal hour right so between the open and the 7 the 8 amm open and the 7 am.
(04:45) High it's only four points so it's not something you know you might be able to scalp that for Four Points it's not something I would really look at as as as viable so what we'll do is we'll just go to the next hour go to the nine o'clock hour and see how that looks all right 9:00 hour sweeps in the second segment even though probability of a retrace is still 94% or uh 83% overall but you're now Sweeping in the second segment so probability drops from 94 to 84 still high but you know you're going to have to make a judgment whether or
(05:21) not you want to trade something like that personally I look for uh first segment sweeps only but let's take a look at this specifically since the probability of retrace is still 84% so we come up we take the high and now what is the distance between the 9:00 a. open and the 8 A.M high it's 25 points so that's a pretty decent amount of of of room I typically like to see anything from 20 to 50 points from that open to that that point of Interest either the high or the low wherever the open is like to see at least 20 to 50 points
(05:57) from that open to the low or the open to the high uh that's that's an ideal range that I think is provides enough room to scalp now if we go from open to the high 25 points if you take it to the high before the drop that's 38 points so anywhere from 25 to 38 points um could potentially be something you could capture back to the open for this this particular move but how do you trade this okay well you're responsible for your entry model uh that could be any number of ways price action um further statistics on on you know extensions
(06:35) from this level up to here average extensions average highs lows Etc um you could use any number of indicators uh let's take a look at just basic price action concept uh let's go to the 30 second chart and this is September 6 of last year so we're going to take this back to September 6 of last year to the 9 o'l hour all right that's loaded and this is a f or 30 second chart so here we are 9:00 open we'll just Mark that off right there 9:00 open takes the 8 o'clock high and what is the nine o'clock open price that would
(07:21) be this candle right here so there's your 9:00 open price this particular tra trade if you use some type of 30-second inversion it's a pretty typical entry model um you know here's a 30 second inversion you have a Gap a gap in price where price trades up creates a gap and comes back through and closes through that Gap this would have given you specifically on this trade about 13 points now if you wanted to get something a little more a little more larger in terms terms of of of points captured you could go down to a
(08:03) 15sec chart let's see what a 15sec chart that would have gave so going back to September 6 over to the 9:00 am open there okay and is the 9:00 amm open 8 o'clock high mark off that high there's your nine o' and we'll go to to the 9:00 open right here and again so if we waited for the inversion of that 15 second here it is right there and you would come down and be able to take roughly 17 points it's just one example of a trade that you could potentially take if we look at the next hour which would be the 10 o'clock hour
(09:00) what does that end up looking like not enough room to scalp so we'll wait for the next hour uh that is some room but it doesn't look like it would be oh 30 points that's good so we come down we sweep it this is the 11 o'clock hour start from a 30 second chart or 15sec chart and the 11:00 hour comes down it sweeps and here's a gap you could take right here so there's that 10:00 hour low we sweep it right here here is your 15sec inversion for a nice quick scalp and then going to your 11 o'clock open would be this candle right
(09:52) here so there's your open so you would enter right here if you're were using a 15-second inversion Right comes back closes through the Gap there's your entry run it up to the current hour open and that's 30 points so that's 30 points you could have scalped um how you define your risk is up to you how you enter is out to you this is just a common entry model there's 100 ways you could enter on this but again that's just an example of how this how this could be scalped and utilized this could also be something you could use for um bigger
(10:24) bigger trade bias right you wait for a um sweep and then you might take a scap scale off there and maybe you're trying to trade this all the way up to the high right you take that 15sec scalp there's your scale one um you know scale one then maybe you take another scale here scale two at this high and maybe another scale all the way up at the top over here at this high so that's how you use our stats if you have any questions please feel free to let me know
