# RTH Breaks Logic

**Source**: NQStats "RTH Breaks" Video Transcript
**Concept**: Probabilities of breaking the Previous Day's Regular Trading Hours (RTH) High/Low based on where the Current Day opens (09:30 ET).

## 1. Definitions
*   **RTH Session**: 09:30 AM - 16:00 PM ET.
*   **Prior RTH Range**: High and Low established between 09:30-16:00 on the previous trading day.
*   **Current Open**: Price at 09:30 AM ET today.

## 2. Scenarios & Probabilities

### Scenario A: Open INSIDE Prior RTH Range
If 09:30 Open is between Previous RTH High and Low:
*   **Break One Side**: **~73%**. (Most Likely).
*   **Stay Inside**: **~14%**. (Chop Day).
*   **Break Both Sides**: **~13%**. (Outside Day).

**Implication**: If opening inside, expect volatility to take out at least one side. If trending up, target the Prior High.

### Scenario B: Open OUTSIDE Prior RTH Range
If 09:30 Open is Above High or Below Low (Gap Up/Down):
*   **Gap Hold Rule**: There is an **~84% probability** that price will **NOT** traverse the entire range to break the *other* side.
    *   *Example*: If Open > Prior High (Gap Up), there is an 84% chance Prior Low is SAFE.
    *   *Example*: If Open < Prior Low (Gap Down), there is an 84% chance Prior High is SAFE.

**Implication**: Don't fade a gap expecting a full reversal to the other extreme.

## 3. Operational Strategy
*   **Inside Open**: Identify the trend early (e.g., using Initial Balance). Target the Prior RTH High (if Bullish) or Low (if Bearish).
*   **Outside Open**: Respect the gap. If Gapping Up, shorting with a target of Yesterday's Low is a low-probability play (<16%).
