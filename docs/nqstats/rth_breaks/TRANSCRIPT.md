(00:01) [Music] Hey, how's it going? Before we get into this video, INQ Stats does not provide strategy. It does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice. What INQ Stats does do is provide statistical edge derived from historical market performance. Nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind.
(00:29) This video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision. You, as the trader, are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter, exit, and manage any trade you decide to take. With that said, let's get into it. All right, how's it going? This video is going to be on the RTH brakes.
(00:46) So, if you're not familiar with the RTH brakes uh stat, this is it right here, nqstats.comth-breaks. Uh, so what this stat covers is regular trading hours. Regular trading hours runs from 9:30 a.m. to 400 pm Eastern. Now, if we open if if the current day 9:30 open happens to open outside of the prior days regular trading hour window, then here's your probabilities of breaking uh certain price points.
(01:19) And then if we open inside the prior days regular trading hours, here's your probabilities of opening or breaking specific price points as well. Um, and we'll take a quicker look into this. So, we'll look for right off the bat, we'll look for a day where we open inside. Uh, so with that said, here is a inside open. All right.
(01:44) So this is February 4th and February 5th. Here is February 4th's regular trading hours high and the regular trading hours low. Now going into the here's your new session line going into the new session. You're coming up into that New York open at 9:30 open and we open up inside of the prior RTH.
(02:11) Now if we open up inside the prior RTH, what are the stats? stats are we have a 14% chance of staying inside, a 72.6, roughly a 73% probability of breaking one side, and a 13% probability of breaking both sides. So, low low chance that we stay inside or break both sides. It's most likely we're just going to break one side. Um, so how do we, you know, deal with that? How how do we use that information? All right.
(02:42) So, going into this day, we open up inside and we're expecting to break one side. What side are we going to break? Well, we don't know yet because technically that's all the information we have. Um, so we see we open up inside and price starts to trade. It eventually goes and breaks the top side. Uh, you know, and as you trade this, this is a five-minute chart.
(03:04) So, I don't know what kind of entry model you use or how you use it, but this is this is just a specific stat. But if you were to take, you know, some kind of long, I don't know, maybe take like an inversion long or you take some type of swing low system or you have some type of oscillator or timebased entry, whatever it might be, and you take a long, you now have a a bias. Your bias is long.
(03:28) You're in a trade long. You also have a target that has a specific probability to it. So you you know one of these blue lines right here that I've drawn the the low and the high of prior RTH. You know that one of them is going to break. If you're long then your target should at a minimum be that line or that high.
(03:49) Um and you have a probability of of what that should be. Now if you look at factoring in other things here, what about noon curve stat? What about initial balance stats? Uh, those can help you as well. So, when we draw a rectangle around that 930 to 10:30 low for the initial balance, there's your initial balance closure.
(04:12) So, you're looking at all of this right here. That's your initial balance. And this is our noon curve, right? So, as price opens up inside, we know that there is a good chance it's going to break one either the higher low of that prior RTH, right? This high or this low. We know that's going to happen most likely. Um 73% probability. And we trade up.
(04:43) We trade down and we close uh we close the 1030 in the upper portion of that initial balance box. And we know if we close in the upper portion of the initial bounce box, it's likely that we're going to break the high. If we closed in the lower portion, it would be more likely we would break the low. So being that we close in the upper portion, it's most likely that we break the high of initial balance.
(05:09) So that's exactly what ends up happening. Initial bounce high gets broken. We get a price gets a pullback and then it continues up further. Now, when you go into that 11 o'clock hour, you're looking at noon curve setups. So, we're we're we're already trending up. We have the assumption that we're going to be breaking that initial balance high, which it breaks, and then we get a price pullback.
(05:35) If you were to look at how much of a pullback this is, I bet it would be somewhere around 50%. So from that low to that pivot high, there's your 50% and you get a 50% pullback before it hammer hammer candles out and starts going back up. So as you come down into that low on a lower time frame, there's probably all kinds of different model entries you could take here of different systems, but let's say that there's some type of sweep low here that you enter in on.
(06:07) And now you have multiple price targets here. you already have a bias for the day. You you know that you're in a long the noon curve is dictating that you're going to set a new high or low after this 12pm line. And looking at the prior RTH stat, you know that you're going to break either the high or the low. Now, with with all of this stats and and and everything so far, we come up, we come down, we close initial balance, we break initial balance, price pulls back, and then starts to go up again.
(06:43) Now, if this is all you had right there, if that's all you had right there, and I told you that there is a um 73% probability that this high or this low is going to get broken and I told you that there is a 75% probability that and take for example the price right the time right now is 11:30. If I said there's a 75% probability that there will be a either a new high or a new low in PM session and that's talking about this high that New York AM high and that New York AM low.
(07:28) So that bottom low right there. So this low and this high, right? We'll just move initial balance out here. So, if I told you there's a 75% probability that after noon, it's 9:30, that after 12:00 p.m. this high is going to get broken or this low is going to get broken, which one would you assume would likely get broken? Probably this high.
(07:56) And if I told you that there's a 73% probability that this high is going to get broken or this low is going to get broken, which one would you likely assume? You would probably assume that this high is going to get broken just based off of order flow. nothing else other than trend um and and what's what direction favors the probability as as price moves on and price trades it ends up breaking the high you get a noon curve new high so on and so forth uh that's how you can use this information this was a particular opens inside now let's go
(08:29) real quick look at a opens outside uh so RTH opens outside see if we can find a day where it opened outside. This was a gap down. Uh I think this is outside. Yeah. So here's your high. Here's your low and price opens up that candle right there opens up outside. So if you open outside of prior RTH, the probability and this is above.
(09:05) If we open above prior RTH, there's an 84% probability that we do not break the low of prior RTH. So, what does that mean? That means that there's an 84% probability that price does not come all the way down to this low and and break that that low, this low right here. 84% probability that we do not break that low.
(09:30) What does that do for you as a trader? Uh, that can help with all kinds of things, right? your bias, your trade direction, avoiding trades, etc., etc. It would probably not be in the best of interest to come down into this this low area here and be taking a short with the expectation of prior day low, right? That would that would not it's low probability.
(09:57) It's not to say that you can't take a short for some points, but your price target should not be expecting to enter somewhere short here or somewhere short here and taking that trade all the way down to the low. That should not be your expectation because from a probability perspective, there is only a 15, you know, 16% probability that that would happen.
(10:22) Um, so you would need to consider exiting that trade prior. uh maybe being a little tighter on your trails or going break even a little quicker. Um taking maybe 20 30 points instead of trying to take the multiund points, whatever it might be. Um lots of lots of lots of information that that could uh you know control. Now that's taking a trade.
(10:45) Let's say if you're already in a trade, let's say if price opens outside and we're not expecting that low to happen and we take a a short somewhere up here. here. I mean, I don't know your entry model, but let's say you enter somewhere short up in here and it's time to start trading down.
(11:02) So, you're trading down and price takes this low. So, maybe you scale out some there. Price trades down into this gap. Maybe you take some there. Or maybe you fully exit. Or maybe you're even expecting this internal low right here to be ran as your final profit target. What you should not be expecting is this load to be ran all the way down here.
(11:24) That should not be a profit target. That profit target only has a 16% chance of getting hit, not probable. So, you should adjust your expectations to not come down and take that low. Uh that is how you can use this information. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.
(11:44) Otherwise, take care and uh have a good day.
