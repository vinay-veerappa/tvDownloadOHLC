(00:11) hey how's it going before we get into this video inq stats does not provide strategy it does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice what inq stats does do is provide statistical Edge derived from historical market performance nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind this video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision you as the trader are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter exit and
(00:37) manage any trade you decide to take with that said let's get into it all right how's it going this video is going to be on the noon curve stat uh so what's on the screen this is just from the website U quick overview of what this is and how to use it uh the newon curve is just a concept I came up with um and it it basically just says that during what I Define as the New York session I know I know the New York session starts at 9:30 ends at 4: but I run it from
(01:12) 8:00 a to 4 p.m. it gives me a full 8 Hour window with four hours on each side of noon and that accounts for New York pre-market volume as well starting at 8 um so I start the New York session at 8:00 a.m in terms of statistics uh and what the new curve says is that you will have during that eight hour block of time with a midline of noon uh 74% of the time you'll have a low on one side and a high on the other side and what that translates to uh when you're looking at a chart is it is it just looks like this so when we look at past few sessions here um today is the 24th
(01:53) of March so we start going through and just looking at past sessions you can see there's a low right here here and a wick high right there closing out closing out the session uh this day there's a high and a low on the same side the morning side this day high low opposite sides this day uh high low same side this day we had opposite sides uh this day we had opposite sides as well High into that bar 742 yep uh here's another opposite side same side and so forth and so forth as you go on there's another opposite same
(02:48) opposite opposite um and what that stat is saying is that 74% of the time you'll have high on one side high on the low side easy um going down the N curve as you get more into finer grain stats on this particular metric um you can look at when those highs and lows form uh so if we're looking at you know let's just use this as an example if we're looking at okay if we're expecting a high and the low to form on different sides of this midline in this eight hour box uh when can we typically expect the high and when can we typically expect
(03:27) the lows for those two sides uh so for the New York am high and low so in that first section of that box that first half uh you can expect typically that high or that low to form around that 930 Mark and that makes sense when you think about 930 Market volatility injection from the New York open and then in the PM you can typically expect that higher low to form around that 2: to 300 p.m.
(03:56) eastern time window with the bulk of it you know peeking out around the 2:30 time uh so if we think about 9:30 and like that 2 to three area our 930 is right here so there's about your typical high window and then when we're looking at that 2 to 3 pm window um this low forms right at 2 o00 uh so it's right about in line with where you would expect those highs and lows to form right around that 9 to 10 and then that 2 to three uh so again we got that that 9 to 10 window window and then that 2 to three window um and then lastly getting into
(04:36) uh percent net change so when we look at percent net change from the 8 am open specific to those highs and lows uh looking at from the 8 am open to the New York am high or the New York Am low so that first half of that box uh typically from that distribution of sample you can expect that high and that low to form around the half a percentage mo
(05:05) ve from the 8 a.m. so this is this kind of Peaks out in between about 4.5% and then same for this right about 0.5% from the 8 A.M uh open so when we look at where is the 8m open that's the start of uh this candle right here and we say okay how far from this open to this High did we go um 60 something points percentage wise what is that uh roughly 34% uh so 34% when we look at the the example distribution here 34% puts us like right right about there uh why is this magnifying glass on point 34% puts us right about there so it's within that
(05:58) higher portion of that Bell that distribution flow um we're right about in that little high point there now we when we look at the low how far is the low from the 8 A.M open so again we go in that that first red bar right there there's the open and then down to that uh PM low when we look at the PM low 8 a.m.
(06:24) eastern open to New York PM low that's typically around it Peaks out around 1.25% drop uh it could be you know anywhere between like a 1.75 to about a one 75 it kind of Peaks out around the 1.25 uh so how how much did we drop into that low uh 1.83% so 1.83% puts us right about here uh it's still within the higher portion of that that that curve uh it's just not at the peak so it's not it's not a complet compl optimal low in terms of percent move but it's still it's still in that high probability window of You
(07:06) Know sample you wouldn't expect it to be way down here and you wouldn't expect it to be way down here you would expect those highs and those low lows to form around where that curve kind of Peaks out so at a 1.8 you're you're right about here near the near the top of that Hill um so from a from a typical New York session 8 a.m.
(07:30) to 4m p.m. factoring in noon curve uh this was a rather average day a pretty typical day in terms of statistics uh we opened at 8: a.m. we set the high within that that 9 to 10:00 right around that 9:30 window we set the high uh it was you know 3637 whatever. 35 whatever it was move that again that falls within that that high probable outcome area for a high and then we move down 1.
(08:04) 8% to set the low in the PM right around that high probable you know High portion of that distribution uh and we set the low in the PM so pretty average day now how do you use all this um this is this can be used in many different ways right so it can be it can be used for PM bias if you're trading and that 8m opens up and you know we trade up and we trade down and we go back here we come down here uh as we're coming down into this low and and noon is approaching when price is uh and let me drop this down to a slightly lower time
(08:42) frame just so it's easier to follow along where was that day at I think it's this day uh so here's a five minute time frame so as price is moving down right we get into that 8 a.m. open we we we punch a high we form a low a lower high and then a lower low low now Market is you know trending down setting new lows setting lower highs the expectation going into the PM session breaking that noon midpoint right we're not going to expect uh statistically from a statistical statistical standpoint fumbling my words we're not going to
(09:21) expect into that pm to do that right that's not that's not the expectation we're not we're not expecting to come you know all the way down forming this this this trending down market and then all of a sudden just go up for new highs that's that's not the expectation that expectation doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of price flow there's other stats that you can use that would insinuate continuation down um this this is not a bias based stat but what it is telling you is that there's going to be a new
(09:56) low or a new high in PM about 75% of the time uh you have to now if you didn't see the rest of that time that movement this is all you had to go off of this first 4H hour portion of time the the general you know assumption here is where where might we be going um well if you look all the way over to the left there's some swing lows over here those could be potential targets for PM session if you were expecting lower price um from a probability standpoint we know that there's a 75% chance that a high a new high or a new
(10:33) low sets in the PM session so as price starts to move I would be anticipating lower I would not be anticipating price to come all the way back up here that's just based off of narrative some context just seeing an overall downtrend uh some other metrics might tell you down as well some other portions or pieces of your strategy or your model but as price is is moving into that PM session would be expecting down price now I I know that I have a 75% chance of either breaking this high or breaking this low so when we go into the PM session and
(11:16) there's that swing low that breaks right there for your PM Target uh so when we're when we're we're right here in time I would like to see some type of trade up right I mean I don't want to just short the lows I want to see some type of trade up to get in short if I'm expecting new low in PM so I would be waiting for some type of move up so as we move up there you have some type of move up uh and again you'd have to have your own strategy your own entry model Etc maybe that meets it for you I don't know um but as price moves up that could
(11:49) provide some type of lower time frame entry uh for you to get short on then the expectation is this this low is going to be broken in PM uh so it just gives you some expectation of price in terms of where price might go in the PM session this can help you with uh narrative for an entry you might already have uh let's say that you know you longed right here um you know you long somewhere in here around this 11:35 1140 window uh it's probably not ideal long because you are then fighting a 75 % probability with with a high chance of
(12:34) low forming now now again if you long down here it could go all the way up here but that that's not very likely given the downtrend that we're starting to see with these higher or these lower highs and these lower lows it's probably not very likely that you're going to see price run up in set a new high in PM for that you know New York window uh what's more likely is setting a new low so if you long here you're now fighting Trend and you're fighting probability um so it can help you with that it can help you with you know
(13:10) avoiding entering a trade that might not be a high probable trade it can also help you with expectations for a trade you're currently in let's say you enter in short somewhere up here right you enter in short in this little pocket of high up here um and you start trading down uh now you break a low you know you might be able to scale some at this low this little interim low right here maybe you scale some in here uh but but you don't technically need to really think about fully exiting yet because if we're trending down and we're already down at
(13:45) these lows then we're going into the PM session noon curve tell you there's a 75% chance of a new high or low forming the expectation would be a new low so you could hold on to a little bit of that position and take it lower uh into the PM session so it can help you with expectation of a current position it can also help you avoiding taking positions that are not high probable trades so just looking at this this particular day again there was that swing low uh you know price set the high in that in that window of time and in that
(14:19) window of of net change move that we would expect it to set and same for the low it's within that high probable uh time window and price window from the 8 A.M open that is how you use new curve you can go through and look at all your charts you can run your own tests and samples you'll find the probability of a high and a low on different sides of this 8 to 4 p.m.
(14:41) Eastern box it's roughly 75% of the time um for this particular sample I used 2004 to 2024 so 20 years of price data got me these statistics right here so you will expect same side to form around 20% of the time same side pm and and that's likely due to those high impact news right all the high impact news typically happens in the morning so if you set a big low and a big high and then the PM session just trades internal to that those are probably going to be your 20% days um or a day where you know the market trended up for the morning
(15:18) portion and then the PM kind of pulls back and does nothing doesn't happen often but it does happen uh the morning portion usually has more volatility uh so that's why you'll see that that 20% for the for the am now then the PM it's very rare that you're going to set the high and the low in the same same time in the PM you shouldn't expect that it's 5% chance or 5% probability u based off the historical 20 years of historical data and then opposite sides about 75% of the time uh so that's how you use this data
(15:51) uh that is how you can put it together and and use it in your trading and if you guys have any questions as always just let me know
