# Noon Curve Logic

**Source**: NQStats "The Noon Curve" Video Transcript
**Concept**: Analyzing the time distribution of the Day's High and Low relative to 12:00 PM (Noon) ET.

## 1. Definition
*   **Session**: 08:00 AM - 16:00 PM ET (8 Hours).
*   **Midline**: 12:00 PM (Noon).
*   **AM Session**: 08:00 - 12:00.
*   **PM Session**: 12:00 - 16:00.

## 2. Statistical Claims
*   **Opposite Sides (The Edge)**: **~74-75%** of the time, the Session High and Session Low form on **opposite sides** of Noon.
    *   *Example*: If the High is set in the AM (e.g., 9:30), the Low is likely to form in the PM.
*   **Same Side (AM)**: **~20%** of the time, both High and Low form in the AM.
*   **Same Side (PM)**: **~5%** of the time, both High and Low form in the PM.

## 3. Timing Expectations
*   **AM High/Low**: Typically forms around **09:30 - 10:00**.
*   **PM High/Low**: Typically forms around **14:00 - 15:00** (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM).

## 4. Operational Use
If we have a confirmed High in the AM and prices are trending down into Noon:
*   **Expectation**: A new Low will form in the PM session (to satisfy the "Opposite Side" stat).
*   **Avoid**: Betting on a reversal to break the AM High (which would put High/Low on the same side or require a massive move).

## 5. Net Change (Confluence)
*   The video mentions "Net Change SDEVs" as a confluence tool, stating that Highs/Lows often form at specific % distances from the 08:00 Open.
