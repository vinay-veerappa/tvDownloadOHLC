(00:01) [Music] hey how's it going before we get into this video inq stats does not provide strategy it does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice what inq stats does do is provide statistical Edge derived from historical market performance nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind this video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision you as the trader are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter exit and
(00:37) manage any trade you decide to take with that said let's get into it all right how's it going uh this video is going to be on the aln sessions um we're going to look through some examples we're going to go over the stats themselves and just um you know figure out how to utilize this right so the information's on the website we'll look at the website real quick um but this video is going to be sort of a more detailed overview with some examples uh so aln sessions refers to the Asian London and New York markets now other
(01:13) people might Define these differently in terms of time but this is how I Define them so the Asian session it utilizes the actual Asian market hours which runs from 800 PM Eastern to 2 amm Eastern simple as that now the London session uh technically runs from 3:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. eastern but for the purpose of these stats I run it from 2 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
(01:40) uh reason being is that much like the New York session pre-market Traders come in around that 8:00 time you have the 8:30 news um you have a lot of positioning around that 8 to 9:00 window and that those are your New York session pre-market Traders London has pre-market Traders as well if you watch volume a lot of volume starts to come in around the 2: a.m.
(02:04) up until that 3:00 a.m. open uh so I classify the London session for the the purpose of this stat as 2 amm I run it to 8:00 a.m specifically because that's when I pick New York up and then New York just runs to the the standard 4M close all right so Asian London and New York session times now getting into the four components of this you'll have London Eng golf's a that's where London takes both sides of the Asian market what will New York do right uh you have where Asia engulfs London so the opposite London will trade and it stays inside the Asian
(02:45) market what will New York do um this this does not happen often over this sample period 10 years from 2015 to 2025 this has only happened 168 times out of 2 2,490 trading sessions uh so it does not happen very often 7% of the time um should not be really something you expect to happen but if it does or when it does I have the stats for that uh next will be London partially engulfs upward so when the London session takes the high of the Asian session but not the low and then inverse to that when the London partially
(03:25) engulfs downwards the London session takes the Asian session low but not the high um so getting into examples of seeing this on a chart um I'll justas these circles here and um this will go back let's see where we at time wise this goes back to January so pretty much all of 2025 so far we'll just go through the charts and see if we can find some examples so here is an example of the um Asia engulfs London right so Asia trades wider uh than the London session London trades inside Asia what can you expect you can expect 74% of the
(04:09) time B from that historical data 74% probability that the New York session will take the Asia high so it will take the red box High um 63% probability that it will take the red box low and 42% that it will just take both sides engulfs both sides so going into this day uh New York session opens up it runs up takes that high so that high again had a 74% probability of getting taken uh now that the high is taken expecting this low so expecting this low now that this High has been taken uh the expectation is not to see
(04:54) the low yes it does happen here um but that that low getting traded through there's only a 42% probability of that uh so while it did happen on this particular day it's not high probability it would not have been my expectation uh based off a historical data um and it would not have been probably a trade I took now if if somebody else has a different model that trades that great uh but from a statistical standpoint low probability that that gets hit uh so that was a um Asia engulfs London let's see if we can find a
(05:31) London and gulf's Asia um that's London and gulf's Asia maybe let's see there's another one and maybe there's one more recently there's another one all right so we got three just within you know the last within the January time period um when we're looking at Asia or you know London and gulf's Asia that's when London and golf's both sides of Asia what are the probabilities so 80% probability that the New York high or that New York session takes the London high or the London low so blue box low or blue box High 80 prob 80% probability
(06:14) that one of those will get traded through 64% probability that both get traded through so going into the New York session right this is all you would see both sides London takes both sides and now you're bounc in up here you're kind of back into the middle of a or London your expectation is this high and this low there's an 80% probability that one of those will get taken there is a 64% probability uh that both of those will get taken so New York session opens up and let's see what we got uh we start to Pivot and it takes the the London
(06:57) high so 80% probability if this pivoted up and you know I'm not going to get into strategy or specifics of how you would trade but you know there's some gaps here there might be some iish order blocks if that's what you trade there might be some oscillator signals here if that's what you trade there could be supply and demand zones here if that's what you trade uh based off of these highs over here uh all kinds of stuff that you could get long on this not not going to go into strategy but let's say You Take Along somewhere in this area uh
(07:29) you now have a expectation from a probability perspective of running to this high right now after you take that high maybe that's a scale out maybe that's a full exit I don't I don't know if I was long somewhere in here running to this high at 715 I mean that's that's over 50 points I'm probably fully exiting taking my money and walking away but perhaps you know that might be a scale point at the minimum it should be a scale point now that high gets taken and let's see what price continues to do it pivots back pretty pretty hard
(08:04) actually and breaks all these lows um you know now maybe you take a short uh somewhere up in here and you have the expectation of this low 64% probability that this low gets taken when price comes down and takes that low it completes out the the engulf right so we go and we take the high 80% probability that we'll take the low of the high we take the high there's now a 64% probability that we're going to come and take the low um and we end up taking the low now both sides are done and from a session a sessional perspective
(08:41) probability perspective based off sessions that the stat is over there's nothing else to trade um you could utilize different days higher time frames yada yada but from this particular stat just looking at Asia London and New York sessions of of points to trade to there's nothing left to trade this day is over relative to this stat so um if you caught the long to the high and then the short to the low great you're done done for the day whatever happens rest of the day you're not interested again if specifically using
(09:16) this stat all right now going into a different day uh let see if we can find a that just doesn't happen often 7% of the time so not really going to bother with trying to find one of those but uh partially engulfs upwards there should be quite a few of those um here's a partially engulfs upwards so that's what you would see going into the 8:00 New York session start uh price has been trending up recently pivot down Trends up pivot down Trends up and you get a partial engulf upward so you get this now you have a 78% probability of
(09:57) taking the high 63 of taking the low so what that means is 78% probability of taking this High 63% probability of taking this low during the New York session New York session opens there's your open um you know and again entry model whatever the case may be however you trade uh price pivots down forms you know pivot up yada yada and takes the high so now the high is out of the way uh that had a 78% probability of getting taken now what about trending back down and taking the the full engulf right the full low um so again looking at the
(10:43) the stats from the last 10 years we've already taken the high so this is this is out of the way uh there is a 36% probability we're going to take the entire overnight session right so fully engulfs both sides low probability of that happening that should not be the expectation there's a 54% probability that we're going to take the Asian low but we've already taken the high so all that's left now is potentially taking the London low or the Asian low for a full engulf um London low has a 63% probability so we've entered uh you know we we got long we we
(11:23) ran it to this High 78% probability now the Market's trading you know continues to trade up uh big pivot back down and let's just say maybe you got I don't know maybe you got long or short rather somewhere up here price is trading down and you have a 63% probability that this low will get traded to um so if you're short right this low should not be your final exit Target or overall Target you should likely be targeting this low because of the 63% probability of it getting tagged um take into consideration also
(12:05) the noon curve Factor here if you're not familiar with the noon curve go look at that stat in that video um but you have new curve right here so if you're expecting highs or new lows whatever the case may be um but again price starts to trade down and takes out the low um now from a probability perspective the day is done right so we've taken the two high probability targets 78 and 63 we're not expecting the Asia low that only has 54 and to take the Asian low would mean a full engulf and that's that's 36% probability
(12:38) so going into the rest of this day you're not expecting this low low probability that this low hits it ends up hitting and sometimes that happens that's why the probability is you know 36% um it's not zero it happens 36 out of 100 times uh so it does happen on this particular day and that closes out the session um let's see if we can find just maybe one or two more examples uh here's another example of partial engulf up so price is uptrending coming out of session open down we save the low save that low price uptrends pullback new
(13:26) high uh higher low and you're going into New York New York session so into New York session the probability expectation is 78% probability that this high will get tagged um a 63% probability that the London low will get traded to and a 54% probability that the Asian low will get traded to now what happens New York opens up it runs a little bit High it pivots down and just goes and takes right that's the 930 open so that makes sense that big volatility injection um but again it just goes and runs and takes the high uh so now that high probability
(14:12) 78% probability Target is out of the way we we've now taken that it's no longer a Target now there's only a 63% probability we come back and take this low um not super high but better than a coin flip uh based off of the uptrend you might not be expecting or considering that that would happen um so price trades down and then just Rockets up there's the rest of your session but that was your high probability uh Target right there and we'll look at maybe one more example of a see if we can find a oh there you go there is a um
(14:47) London gets engulfed by Asia so this exact example where London trades inside Asia it only happens 7% of the time historically over the last 10 years not something you would really expect to happen but if it does um the probabilities are New York will take the Asian high so let's go right there New York will take the Asian high so this High 74% of the time it will take the Asian low 63% of the time and both sides 42% of the time so New York session opens does a little you know you're already in an uptrend right
(15:32) so uh coming into this low higher lows pivot down new high and another pivot down so you're already in an uptrend of sorts um coming into the New York session you get a pivot down perhaps your entry model triggers you to go long some point in that price movement uh now you're long and now you have an expectation of a high and that high get get ran 74% probability that that high would get ran um and that's your Asia engulfs London uh look for one more example of a downward so um there's your downward the high probability would have been the low
(16:17) right so when we're looking at partially engulfed downward 82% probability of the low London low 58% London high and then low probability for the rest so going into this this was an outlier day in terms of probability uh the expectation would have been the low but the low did not get taged and then low probability for the rest of those targets uh one more example there's an internal London uh engulfs up so here's an engulfs down um that that low gets taken but not much of a way to get short on that it just kind of Fades out once 8
(16:57) A.M opens up so not really a good example even though it works out but just not really giving much of a an a way to enter um but again looking at the stats London partially engulfs downwards so what's the probability what's New York going to do New York
(18:17) will take the London low blue box low 82% of the time it will take the blue box High London High 58% of the time and then the rest you would not expect uh the would be um logical areas to not think price would go to thus avoiding or or taking off the trade and profit before those targets um so as you go into the New York session you you know you're already in somewhat of a downtrend lower high lower low lower high lower low lower high Etc you're already in a downtrend and New York session opens up it pivots up a little bit there's your
(19:01) pivot up a little bit runs out this high does not take this high and perhaps there's some type of Divergence here with es something like that I mean I don't I don't really know however you trade your entry model but you have a probability perspective um of of this low getting taken 82% of the time historically given this pattern so if you get short up here somewhere you have an 82% % probability that this low will get taken um up in the 800s 820s down to this low 750s um that's about you know 50 points or so a profit good good trade good
(19:43) short and price ends up taking that low so that is how you could utilize that it's just a expectation so where where price was what pattern it created probability of those highs and lows getting taken to be a Confluence or validate your bias of short or long that is how you use Al in sessions um if you have any questions feel free to let me know
(20:25) uh this can be combined pretty well uh if you look up the rth breaks initial balance breaks noon curve uh other other probability Concepts that revolve around time um if you look up
(20:59) though you know price and time if you look up those those those all Mingle well with Alin sessions it can help provide uh double Confluence triple Confluence for a specific price point getting taken right so if you're already if you if you're already going into the session with an 82% probability expectation of this low getting hit perhaps the initial balance um you know that 9:30 to 10:30 window of time you're expecting the low to get ran which would you know help with this or maybe the rth uh if we if we open up internal
(21:38) right so here's prior day's New York session so we if we price opens up internal to the prior Day New York session prior rth if price opens internal to that then you have that high probability expectation of one side or the other getting ran um The Logical closer side would be the low right so opening up internal it's it's being that if you're looking at you know where are you closest to where's the path of least resistance you're in the lower portion the lower quadrant of that prior rth it's probably likely to assume that
(21:38) the low will get ran um you're also assuming that the low will get ran on London for the aln sessions maybe initial balance is showing you that the low might get ran too so those are ways you can have kind of double triple quadruple Confluence of a specific price point getting ran um that's how you use it again if you have any questions just feel free to let me know and uh have a good day
