(00:11) hey how's it going before we get into this video inq stats does not provide strategy it does not provide indicators and it does not provide investment or financial advice what inq stats does do is provide statistical Edge derived from historical market performance nothing shown in this video should be taken as advice of any kind this video is providing a tool that could potentially be leveraged to make a trade decision you as the trader are responsible for how you leverage and build around it in addition to how you enter exit and
(00:37) manage any trade you decide to take with that said let's get into it all right how's it going everyone uh this video is going to be on the net change standard deviations uh real quick standard deviations involve collecting data from a sample um I see a lot of people on fin twit I think this stem from like C or something uh calling the FIB tool like FIB extensions calling that standard deviations uh those are not standard deviations all these these influencer you know fwit influencers and Educators out there uh to include ICT they're all
(01:16) calling it the wrong thing uh it's just that simple standard deviation involves taking a sample of data and getting the mean or the average of that data sample whether that's like people's height shoe size um you know it doesn't really matter whatever the sample of data is price uh getting the average and then seeing the variance in the plus or minus um you know the plus or minus uh extension from that mean from that average of that sample of data it is not the same as you know just taking a chart and drawing a a
(01:56) fib tool and then you know saying hey uh just showed me some you know projections out to whatever whatever realm uh you want to see it so like for example you know this little this little down leg and then up might say something like some manipulation leg and then two standard deviation you see people say like down to the two standard deviation for uh some type of reversal then four completes the move you know something like that um it it those are not standard deviations they're just FIB extensions so moving on from that now
(02:31) standard deviations um again this measures variance from the mean so how are we going to get this information first of all uh well you can get this for really any time frame uh personally I use weekly daily and hourly standard deviations um what we're going to go through this example here is daily standard deviations uh so how we will do that is all you really need to collect you can do this any number of ways you can do this externally in Excel you can do this through code and um Pine script thinker swim ninja Trader
(03:03) using C+ like I am uh there's a million ways you can do this but for the purp of this demonstration we'll just use um pretty basic pulling some data and then throwing it throwing it in Excel so what that looks like all we're going to collect here is the close minus the open divided by the open that's going to give us the percent net change for every one of these daily bars so if I take the um close of this big red bar right here I take the close and I minus the open and then I take that value and divide it by the open I now have the net
(03:39) change of that bar and I want that for all the bars in the sample so this sample is going to be th days um so what we're going to do and this is just the last thousand days today is March 12th uh so we're going to run this script it's already installed you'll see over here on the right print statements generate after I refresh so here's all of our bars worth of net changes um it's probably going to be like roughly 700 uh values because um I think a thousand if this is set on a th days yeah it's like 700 actual trading days since it's a th
(04:16) calendar days uh so we'll bring it into Excel for the purpose of this demonstration paste that in so now we have all of our net changes um now I just want to know what's the standard deviation of this of this sample so you can do this in Excel with built-in formulas um we'll we'll go through and do right like what's the 0.
(04:40) 5 sdev and what's the 1.0 uh sdev and then like what's the 2.0 S so how we're going to get this is you just want the one start with the one take the uh stde V.P formula standard deviation of the population and we want that first net change all the way down to the last roughly 700 and now we have that plus or minus percentage and then if we want the 0.
(05:09) five we'll just multiply that value times 0.5 to get half of it then if we want uh the two standard deviation we'll just take that value and multiply it by two to get the two standard deviation so now we have plus or minus percentages um for these net changes so what this is saying and and how you can visualize this is let's look at uh random.
(05:38) org uh or actually measuring u.com we we'll get to random.org here in a little bit um so here's measuring U so what this is saying is one standard deviation submit we'll see the zcore to percentile and that's going to be 68% so what that means is that let's say you have a ton of net changes um boom boom you know daily bar price chart uh yada yada so that is a one day that's one session here's your session open um you know and then you have the rest of the session so what this is saying is to the one standard deviation two-sided it's 68% so all values if this
(06:26) is the one standard the negative 1.0 and this is the the positive 1.0 68% of all values fall within that region now if you change this to let's just say the 2.0 uh that is 95% so like let's just say this was the two and we'll we'll deepen this a little bit let's just say that was the two so for this day um 95% of all values historically fall within this range and this will make more sense when we pull up an indic Ator uh but that's what that is saying now when you look at one-sided so let's look at the 1.
(07:07) 0 one-sided um percentile what this means is this is saying 84% so what this means is is if you are going down and we hit the negative 1.0 or the positive 1.0 it's saying that you have um it's including if you look at the bell curve it's including everything from one side into the percentage or into the percentage so when we go back to two real quick you'll see that this percentage is 68 + 31 uh if you take 31 and divide it in half you get like 15 and a half if you add 15 and a half to 68 you get the one-sided U percentage see how that
(07:52) takes away that that half and adds it to this side so now it's saying that on the move like like let's say if we're going down and we hit the negative 1.0 84% of all net changes happen above that negative 1.0 and again this all makes sense when we look at the indicator just want to provide that initial background um now let's look at just a random day make this a little fair so nobody can say I usually like to do random days so nobody can say it's Cherry Picked um so we'll get date this is just one random day over the last year
(08:31) uh this is saying um April 5th of last year 2024 so what we'll do is we'll go to April 25th of last year and wait what was that April 5th that's right April 5th so this is a Friday all right here's Friday April 5th last year so so now how we're going to look at this we're on a daily chart we want to get down to something smaller let's go to a 15minute and we'll turn the indicator on it's already on we just have to to unhide it all right there you have it so now what this is is doing is let's take a look um we have our net changes we
(09:23) already collected all that right last thousand days I use 20 years of data um you can use 20 years you can use 10 years whatever you whatever you want to use I feel the more data you have the better um so that's why I use a high amount of data uh but this is 20 years worth of net changes this is a 15minute chart so these 0.5 1.0 1.
(09:48) 5 Etc they represent um those percentages remember we talked about those percentages so when we bring back up this chart and I say okay I want to know as price is coming up statistically if we hit the 1.0 net change wise for the session what is the probability that the session will close below the plus 1.
(10:12) 0 all right so one-sided that's 84% probability so when you look at all last 20 years worth of net changes it's at this line 84% of the sessions have closed below this line U now when we look at the five 0 .5 and we just focus on the plus5 uh so we go and we say you know the plus. five here uh that is 69% so roughly 70% of all sessions have closed below that now what about the like the 1.5 right so the 1.
(10:52) 5 is 93 so if you get price all the way up here only 7% of sessions historically have closed above that line um when you get up to the 2.0 let's do that one real quick probably 90 yeah 97 so if price traded all the way up and tapped the 2.0 only only less than 3% of sessions closed above that so this is just math this isn't anything magical that these lines are drawn at session start they don't change throughout the session um this is just purely looking at historical distribution of price on a daily time frame then applying it to any
(11:31) intraday minute based time frame um so that is it in a nutshell now how do you use this personally for me I I tend to stay away from trading around the session open right like all up in this range right here from like the 0. five you know somewhere like in there I don't like to trade in here I don't like to trade in there because price is kind of it can go either way there's no tension on price there's you know if you think of like a rubber band rubber band call this the rubber the Rubber Band Theory if you think of a rubber band the
(12:06) farther you stretch it the more tension there is for it to snap back and that's that's mean reversion uh the farther you stretch price away from the open the mean the more tension there is to pull it back and that tension corresponds to an exact probability based off of the zcore now you can put in like what if you wanted to know um you know what what what what what gives you an 80% probability right because that that is a specific probability uh so if you want to say okay instead of zcore to percentile what
(12:39) about percentile to zcore and they have that on here as well uh I do all this calculation in um ninjas script for my indicator um and if we it's just an idea for those of you who are or Builders out there so I can take it and look at show HD data top left and then now it's it's going to tell me where price is it's saying price is at the 0.
(13:06) 9 deviation right here and there's an 82% chance of reversion so if I go and I'm looking at percentile to zcore and I type in 82% uh and then I go oh this is probably G to want 0.82 perhaps can't remember if it needs that yeah and then we want one-sided all right there you have it so 82% probability 82% and then 0.9 0.9 so at the one at the plus 0.
(13:45) 9 standard deviation of Daily net change 82% of all values or all all sessions have closed below that so how I use this as as price is moving up I know I know the exact probability historically at least speaking from historical price I know the exact probability of sessions closing below current price so when I'm coming up and I see certain percentages and this gets into strategy which I won't speak to um youall can develop your own strategy I'm just showing you the concept and the tool but when you get to certain percentages you can
(14:21) expect um reversion uh think of it as just again price stretching like a rubber band stretching uh so typically you'll see a lot of reversion at the 0.5s the 1.0 and the 1.5s quarter quarter increments but there are some key percentages out there worth exploring and looking into where you'll you'll often find uh very good reversion trades um so that is it in a nutshell I I don't like to trade around the open because there's no tension on price I like to wait till price extends away to specific uh probability of of
(14:57) reversion and then I like to frame my trade ideas around that um up up in here you know at the 1.0 I would probably be looking for short entries um I mean this is last day for I don't even know if I traded this day but uh this is where I would be looking for short entries now how do you also tell if today is going to be a trend day like what if what if the session opened and we just did one of these because that can happen um well this is how you tell so let's look at a day where that happened uh this wasn't a trend day so
(15:30) let's turn on historical sessions see if we can find a trend oh perfect the exact day before so look at Price here price goes from session open trades up into the 0. five and then reverts down through the open look at all these red bars down through the open hits the 0 five still red bars there's no consolidation there's nothing so when you when that happens when there's no consolidation of price you can likely assume that we're going to the next deviation um see how price traded up on this day and kind of Consolidated a
(16:05) little bit that could have been a potential reversal but that's not trending um there's there's tension on price uh obvious tension on price right there as this day was moving down we're just blowing through these deviations and then we ended up closing the session um let's see if there's another example of consol oh here's a good example of consolidation so here we're trading around the open remember we don't like to trade around the open or at least I don't and then we come down to the0 five there's there's no consolidation here
(16:35) there's there's no price stopping we just blow right through it and we go all the way down to the 1.0 all right so now at the 1.0 negative 1.0 um remember the negative 1.0 is ecore to percentile if I do a one-sided this is still set to percentile all right what's what's going on here let's go back to the ccore to percentto so now the 1.
(17:10) 0 one-sided I want to know what's the probability of closing above the 1.0 that probability is 84% so when we're trading around the open remember don't like trades around the open we come down to the negative 0.5 and we blow right through it there's no consolidation I'm not interested in longing that now we come down to the 1.
(17:26) 0 price starts to chop it starts to chop around around here I can logically assume that now we may realize this probability of 84% so we will likely revert back up and that ends up being what price did um there's a million anry models you could use to get in this move I'm not not going to cover that but um that's how you would use this information and we just look at one more day uh this was just a mean trading day mean trading day mean trading day here's a 0.
(18:02) five reversion so very good example um price trades around the mean comes down to the 0. five and you don't blow through you get you get a consolidation of you know Red Bar and then immediately up close bar that closes above the open of that last down close bar so now it's logical to assume that price might want to trade back to the mean so back to the mean the session open could be your target um and so forth and so forth here's another 0.
(18:32) 5 rejection uh there where we blow through up to the 1.0 here's a 0.5 pivot uh here's a trading right through no consolidation up to the 1.0 and then pivot back and again just example after example of of how this plays out um that is how you use this information at least I how I use it I use this is daily deviations I use weekly as well to frame out my my swing trades for the week typically try to position around like the Monday Tuesday time frame then run my trade all through the week uh if I'm taking a larger swing and uh intraday trades I like to frame
(19:06) my intraday trades uh like bigger move intraday trades using daily deviations and then if I'm scalping uh I like to use a combination of hour stats and then hourly standard deviations of net change so that's it that concludes this um you know video and if you guys have any questions about any of this uh just
